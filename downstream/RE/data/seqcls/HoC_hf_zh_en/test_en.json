To identify the regulatory factors involved in this pathway , we constructed a random insertional mutagenesis library using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of A. aculeatus NCP2 , which harbors a transcriptional fusion between the cbhI promoter ( P ( CBHI ) ) and the orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase gene ( pyrG ) . Of the transformants screened , one 5-FOA-resistant transformant , S4-22 , grew poorly on cellulose-containing media and exhibited reduced cellobiose-induced expression of cbhI . Southern blot analysis and nucleotide sequencing of the flanking regions of the T-DNA inserted in S4-22 indicated that the T-DNA was inserted within the coding region of a previously unreported Zn(II)(2)Cys(6)-transcription factor , which we designated the cellobiose response regulator ( ClbR ) .

Here , we demonstrated that DHEA and EPEA were able to reduce cell viability in MCF-7 breast cancer cells whereas they did not elicit any effects in MCF-10A non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells . Since DHA and EPA are ligands of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor ( PPAR ) \u03b3 , we sought to determine whether PPAR\u03b3 may also mediate DHEA and EPEA actions . In MCF-7 cells , both compounds enhanced PPAR\u03b3 expression , stimulated a PPAR response element-dependent transcription as confirmed by the increased expression of its target gene PTEN , resulting in the inhibition of AKT-mTOR pathways .

Using a high-resolution genome-wide mapping technique , followed by extensive locus-specific validation assays , we have identified 24 CpG islands that display significantly higher levels of CpG methylation in immortalized cell lines as compared to primary murine fibroblasts . Several of these hypermethylated CpG islands are associated with genes involved in the MEK-ERK pathway , one of the most frequently disrupted pathways in cancer . Approximately half of the hypermethylated targets are developmental regulators , and bind to the repressive Polycomb group ( PcG ) proteins , often in the context of bivalent chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells . Because PcG-associated aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of several human malignancies , our methylation data suggest that epigenetic reprogramming of pluripotency genes may initiate cell immortalization .

RESULTS In this study , quantitative trait locus analysis was used to define a Mbp region on rat chromosome 10q25 harbouring the lpk mutation . Targeted genome capture and next-generation sequencing of this region identified a non-synonymous mutation R650C in the NIMA ( never in mitosis gene a)- related kinase 8 ( Nek8 ) gene .

Cytokine antibody arrays were applied to study the composition of soluble factors present in these cultures . RESULTS The different survival-supportive culture conditions induced distinct gene expression changes , the majority of which were common to all three conditions . Pathway analyses identified - in addition to known signaling networks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia - novel pathways , of which Toll-like receptor signaling , nuclear respiratory factor-2 ( NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response , and signaling via triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 ( TREM1 ) were the most relevant . A high proportion of up-regulated genes were inflammatory cytokines , of which chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 2 ( CCL2 ) was shown to be induced in monocytes by the presence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro . In addition , increased serum levels of this chemokine were detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia . CONCLUSIONS Our data provide several lines of evidence that an inflammatory microenvironment is induced in survival-supportive cultures of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells which might be directly or indirectly involved in the prolonged survival of the malignant cells .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "id": "21134984"}
{"sentence": "Recently , we identified the \" apoptotic ring, \" containing phosphorylated histone H2AX ( \u03b3-H2AX ) , as an early chromatin modification during apoptosis . Because \u03b3-H2AX initiates the DNA damage response ( DDR ) , we tested whether the apoptotic H2AX response leads to the full recruitment of the DDR factors that normally coordinate DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints . We show that the apoptotic H2AX response does not recruit the DDR factors because MDC1 ( mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 ) , which normally binds to \u03b3-H2AX in response to DNA damage and amplifies the DDR , is cleaved by caspase-3 . This cleavage separates the BRCT and FHA domains of MDC1 and constitutes a novel mechanism for the inactivation of DNA repair in apoptotic cells . Also , we show that downregulation of MDC1 increases the apoptotic response to TRAIL . Together , these results implicate MDC1 in the cellular apoptotic response .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], "id": "21148072"}
{"sentence": "DNA-protein cross-links ( DPCs ) are formed upon exposure to a variety of chemical and physical agents and pose a threat to genomic integrity . In particular , acrolein and related aldehydes produce DPCs , although the chemical linkages for such cross-links have not been identified . Here , we report that oligodeoxynucleotides containing 1,N(2)-deoxyguanosine adducts of acrolein , crotonaldehyde , and trans-4-hydroxynonenal can form cross-links with the tetrapeptide Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys . We concluded that complex formation is mediated by a Schiff base linkage because DNA-peptide complexes were covalently trapped following reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride , and pre-reduction of adducted DNAs inhibited complex formation . A previous NMR study demonstrated that duplex DNA catalyzes ring opening for the acrolein-derived gamma-hydroxy-1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct to yield an aldehydic function ( de los Santos , C. , Zaliznyak , T. , and Johnson , F . ( 2001 ) J. Biol . Chem. 276 , 9077-9082 ) . Consistent with this earlier observation , the adducts under investigation were more reactive in duplex DNA than in single-stranded DNA , and we concluded that the ring-open aldehydic moiety is the induced tautomer in duplex DNA for adducts exhibiting high relative reactivity . Adducted DNA cross-linked to Arg-Trp-Arg-Arg and Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys with comparable efficiency , and N(alpha)-acetylation of peptides dramatically inhibited trapping ; thus , the reactive nucleophile is located at the N-terminal alpha-amine of the peptide .

{"sentence": "UNLABELLED Oxygen free radicals and their reactive derivatives participate in formation of chronic inflammation states , which facilitate development of gastrointestinal tract tumors . Oxidative stress is one of the main causes of damage to cell membranes in result of exacerbated lipid peroxidation process . End products of lipid peroxidation ( aldehydes , organic peroxides ) react with important biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins , cause changes in cell membrane structure and properties leading to loss of its integrity . Intensification of the lipid peroxidation process is a factor which may also lead to a malfunction in the antioxidant barrier , which further weakens the defense of cells against oxygen free radicals and promotes the onset and development of cancer . The aim of the study was the determination of lipid peroxidation level in gastrointestinal tract tumors ( stomach , liver , colon , and colorectal cancer to liver metastases ) . MATERIAL AND METHODS Materials for studies were obtained from 150 patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors : 10 with stomach cancer , 30 with malignant and benign liver cancers , 60 with primary colorectal cancer , and 50 with metachronous colorectal cancer liver metastases . We also investigated 25 patients with liver cirrhosis , which was treated as a pre-cancerous condition . In total , 175 patients were examined . Tumor specimens , and normal adjacent tissues ( 6-7 cm from the edge of the tumor ) , which served as control tissue in studies , were collected from patients ( with their consent ) during surgery . Additionally , liver specimens were collected from patients with liver cirrhosis . Lipid peroxidation level was determined spectrophotometrically as a concentration of final lipid peroxidation products , which in reaction with tiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) form colour complex ( thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances - TBARS ) . RESULTS The study showed the highest concentration of TBARS in benign , and the lowest in malignant liver tumors . Other types of gastrointestinal tumors studied , were characterized by similar levels of lipid peroxidation . TBARS concentration in these tumors was approximately 2-fold higher than in malignant liver tumors and much lower than in benign tumors . In all cancers of the digestive tract with the exception of malignant liver tumors increased level of TBARS was found , comparing with control tissue . The concentration of TBARS in cirrhotic liver was lower than in control . The level of lipid peroxidation in liver cirrhosis and malignant liver tumors was similar . There were no significant differences in TBARS concentration in the tumors of particular sections of the intestine and normal colon . The highest concentration of TBARS was found in G1 grade of colorectal cancer . In subsequent grades of cells differentiation ( G2 and G3 ) its concentration was lower . The highest level of lipid peroxidation , expressed as the concentration of TBARS was found in the I stage of colorectal cancer clinical advancement . The significantly lowest concentration of TBARS was shown for stage II ( UICC ) . CONCLUSIONS The level of lipid peroxidation in cancerous cells of gastrointestinal tract indicates increased oxidative stress . The changes of lipid peroxidation level--a marker of oxidative stress in gastrointestinal tumors appear to be closely associated with their development stages ( liver cirrhosis/malignant liver cancer ; colorectal cancer/colorectal cancer liver metastases ) and are likely to create such conditions , in which cancerous cells may proliferate , undergo gradual dedifferentiation and malignancy , and generate metastases .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "id": "21268915"}

Here , we used a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) mouse model of colitis , which resembles human ulcerative colitis pathology . Resveratrol mixed in food ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice in a dose-dependent manner . Resveratrol significantly improves inflammation score , downregulates the percentage of neutrophils in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lamina propria , and modulates CD3(+) T cells that express tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IFN-gamma . Markers of inflammation and inflammatory stress ( p53 and p53-phospho-Ser(15) ) are also downregulated by resveratrol . Because chronic colitis drives colon cancer risk , we carried out experiments to determine the chemopreventive properties of resveratrol . Tumor incidence is reduced from 80% in mice treated with azoxymethane ( AOM ) + DSS to 20% in mice treated with AOM + DSS + resveratrol ( 300 ppm ) . Tumor multiplicity also decreased with resveratrol treatment . AOM + DSS-treated mice had 2.4 +/- 0.7 tumors per animal compared with AOM + DSS + 300 ppm resveratrol , which had 0.2 +/- 0.13 tumors per animal .

Interactions in the model are based on activities of individual phospho-epitopes and binding sites of proteins involved in G2/M .

The number of PSCs isolated from wild type ( WT ) mice was 50% higher than those from the Pfizer P2X7 receptor knock out ( KO ) mice . The P2X7 receptor protein and mRNA of all known isoforms were expressed in WT PSCs , while KO PSCs only expressed truncated versions of the receptor .

Mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction has been proposed to be one of the major causes for such glycolytic shift . This hypothesis has been revisited as tumors appear to undergo waves of gene regulation during progression , some of which rely on functional mitochondria . In this framework , the role of mitochondrial complex I is still debated , in particular with respect to the effect of mitochondrial DNA mutations in cancer metabolism . The aim of this work is to provide the proof of concept that functional complex I is necessary to sustain tumor progression . METHODS Complex I-null osteosarcoma cells were complemented with allotopically expressed complex I subunit 1 ( MT-ND1 ) . Complex I re-assembly and function recovery , also in terms of NADH consumption , were assessed . Clones were tested for their ability to grow in soft agar and to generate tumor masses in nude mice . Hypoxia levels were evaluated via pimonidazole staining and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\\u03b1 ( HIF-1\\u03b1 ) immunoblotting and histochemical staining. 454-pyrosequencing was implemented to obtain global transcriptomic profiling of allotopic and non-allotopic xenografts . RESULTS Complementation of a truncative mutation in the gene encoding MT-ND1 , showed that a functional enzyme was required to perform the glycolytic shift during the hypoxia response and to induce a Warburg profile in vitro and in vivo , fostering cancer progression . Such trigger was mediated by HIF-1\\u03b1 , whose stabilization was regulated after recovery of the balance between \\u03b1-ketoglutarate and succinate due to a recuperation of NADH consumption that followed complex I rescue .

Loss of contact inhibition is one characteristic hallmark in tumorigenesis . In rat liver epithelial WB-F344 cells , TCDD induces a release from contact inhibition , which is manifested by a twofold increase in cell number when TCDD ( 1 nM for 48 h ) is added to confluent cells in the presence of serum , but not when given to exponentially growing or subconfluent , serum-deprived WB-F344 cells . Loss of G1 arrest was also shown by flow cytometric analysis . We demonstrate that TCDD treatment significantly increases cyclin D2 and cyclin A protein levels and show by immunofluorescence that these proteins accumulate in the nucleus . Although TCDD treatment leads to a strong increase in cyclin D2/cdk4 and cyclin A/cdk2 complex formation , we could only detect an elevation of cyclin A/cdk2 activity . In accordance with a lack of elevated cdk4 activity , no decrease in the amount of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein could be shown after TCDD treatment . The importance of increased cyclin A/cdk2 activity for TCDD-dependent release from contact inhibition was shown by the fact that the cdk2/cdc2-specific inhibitor olomoucine ( 25 microM ) abolished TCDD response .

New anthracyclines have been designed and tested , but the first ones discovered , doxorubicin and daunorubicin , continue to be the drugs of choice . Despite their extensive use in chemotherapy , little is known about the DNA repair mechanisms involved in the removal of lesions caused by anthracyclines . The anthracycline cosmomycin D is the main product isolated from Streptomyces olindensis , characterized by a peculiar pattern of glycosylation with two trisaccharide rings attached to the A ring of the tetrahydrotetracene . METHODS We assessed the induction of apoptosis ( Sub-G1 ) by cosmomycin D in nucleotide excision repair-deficient fibroblasts ( XP-A and XP-C ) as well as the levels of DNA damage ( alkaline comet assay ) . RESULTS Treatment of XP-A and XP-C cells with cosmomycin D resulted in apoptosis in a time-dependent manner , with highest apoptosis levels observed 96 h after treatment . The effects of cosmomycin D were equivalent to those obtained with doxorubicin . The broad caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK strongly inhibited apoptosis in these cells , and DNA damage induced by cosmomycin D was confirmed by alkaline comet assay . CONCLUSIONS Cosmomycin D induced time-dependent apoptosis in nucleotide excision repair-deficient fibroblasts .

The aim of this study was to examine the chronological and spatial patterns of osteosarcoma growth and invasion of local tissue structures including epiphyseal cartilage . METHODS We used an in vivomouse model of osteosarcoma to histologically examine tumors at different stages of disease progression . We compared the pattern of osteosarcoma penetration of epiphyseal cartilage with the expression pattern of two potent mediators of angiogenesis ; proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and antiangiogenic pigment epithelium-derived factor ( PEDF ) . RESULTS Epiphyseal cartilage remained intact across its entire length in all sections examined , despite increasing tumor size as well as intra- and extraosseous destruction . In the most advanced cases , only the proangiogenic lowermost layers of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate were eroded . This corresponded with the growth plate layers which highly expressed the angiogenic factor VEGF . In contrast , the resting , proliferative and upper hypertrophic layers were resistant to osteosarcoma invasion in all cases . This corresponded to the layers with the highest expression of the potent antiangiogenic factor PEDF . CONCLUSION Epiphyseal cartilage is resistant to local invasion by osteosarcoma .

METHODS Selected were 30-week-old HER2/neu transgenic spontaneous breast cancer mice FVB/neu . The primary tumor resection was carried out . After surgery they were randomly divided into the blank control group , the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group ( RSR + Herceptin group ) . The treatment lasted for 4 months .

METHODS MACC1 and c-met expressions were detected in 103 cases of NSCLC and 40 cases of neighboring normal lung cancer tissue using immunohistochemistry . RESULTS MACC1 and c-met expressions were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues than that in neighboring normal tissue ( P<0.001 ) . MACC1 and c-met expressions were associated with poor differentiation , advanced T stages , lymph node metastasis , and advanced TNM stages ( P<0.05 ) of NSCLC , but not with sex , age , smoking , and histological classification ( P>0.05 ) . In addition , a positive correlation between MACC1 and c-met expressions was observed ( r=0.403 , P<0.001 ) .

{"sentence": "PURPOSE : Acid ceramidase ( AC ) occupies an important place in the control of cancer cell proliferation . We tested the influence of AC inhibition on the effects of PSC 833 , a P-glycoprotein antagonist with potent ceramide-generating capacity , to determine whether AC could be a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer . METHODS : Ceramide metabolism was followed using ( 3)H-palmitate , and molecular species were determined by mass spectroscopy . Apoptosis was measured by DNA fragmentation , autophagy by acridine orange staining , and cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry and RB phosphorylation . AC was measured in intact cells using fluorescent substrate . RESULTS : Exposure of human PANC-1 or MIA-PaCa-2 cells to PSC 833 promoted increases in de novo ( dihydro)ceramides , ( dihydro)glucosylceramides , and ( dihydro)sphingomyelins , demarking ceramide generation and robust metabolism . Despite the multifold increases in ( dihydro)ceramide levels , cells were refractory to PSC 833 . However , PSC 833 produced a dose-dependent decrease in DNA synthesis and dose- and time-dependent decreases in RB phosphorylation , consistent with cell cycle arrest as demonstrated at G1 . Cytostatic effects of PSC 833 were converted to cytotoxic end-point by acid ceramidase inhibition . Cytotoxicity was accompanied by formation of acridine orange-stained acidic vesicles and an increase in LC3 expression , indicative of autophagic response . Cell death was not reversed by preexposure to myriocin , which blocks PSC 833-induced ceramide generation .

The exact mechanism of action of sinecatechins in eradication of human papillomavirus-induced external genital and perianal warts is unknown , but may be due to one or more of the mechanisms mentioned . Objective : This study was conducted to investigate the growth inhibitory potential of the sinecatechins in human cervical carcinoma cell lines infected with human papillomavirus . Methods : The viability of tumor cell lines ( CaSki and SiHa infected with human papillomavirus-16 ; HeLa and C4-I infected with human papillomavirus-18 ) was investigated as one parameter in a short-term viability assay ( 48 hours ) . This was followed by a long-term clonogenic assay ( 12-23 days ) to determine the cytotoxic potential of sinecatechins as a parameter for cell viability and proliferation . This assay determined if the effect observed in the viability assay was due to retardation in cell proliferation or to a reduction of total cell number , leading to cell death . Results : Based on the data collected , sinecatechins inhibited cell growth in all four tumor cell lines by 50 percent ( GI(50) ) at concentrations ranging from 160 to 360\ufffdM . C4-I cells were the most sensitive to treatment with sinecatechins , with a lower GI(50) ( Total GI was achieved in a 48-hour assay at 625\ufffdM sinecatechins ( 40\ufffdM for C4-I ) , with growth inhibitory potential detectable after one hour . Clonogenic assays confirmed the cytotoxic potential of sinecatechins with a reduction in clone numbers in a concentration-dependent fashion . Sinecatechins substantially reduced the number of surviving HeLa cells at a concentration of 200\ufffdM , while surviving SiHa cells were almost totally eradicated with a concentration of 600\ufffdM . Conclusion : Sinecatechins demonstrated growth inhibitory potential in all four human papillomavirus-infected tumor cell lines , which may be attributed to the induction of apoptosis , mediated by cell cycle deregulation . In addition , this antiproliferative effect may contribute to the overall cancer-preventative function and possible direct antiviral activity of sinecatechins that may contribute to external genital and perianal warts clearance .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "22468171"}

HOX11 is also leukaemogenic , both through its clinical association with childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , and its ability to immortalize other haematopoietic cell lineages experimentally . To examine the pathological role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis , we constitutively expressed HOX11 cDNA in J2E murine erythroleukaemic cells , which are capable of terminal differentiation . Enforced HOX11 expression was found to induce a profound alteration in J2E cellular morphology and differentiation status . Our analyses revealed that HOX11 produced clones with a preponderance of less differentiated cells that were highly adherent to plastic . Morphologically , the cells overexpressing HOX11 were larger and had decreased globin levels , as well as a reduction in haemoglobin synthesis in response to erythropoietin ( EPO ) . Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the immature erythroid phenotype imposed by HOX11 , with clones transfected with HOX11 demonstrating expression of the c-Kit stem cell marker , while retaining EPO receptor expression . Taken together , these results show that HOX11 alters erythroid differentiation , favouring a less mature progenitor-like stage .

G401 cells grow without contact inhibition , which is an in vitro characteristic property of malignant tumor cells . At concentrations of HB-19 that does not affect cell viability and multiplication index , there is restoration of contact inhibition thus suggesting that HB-19 treatment causes reversion of the malignant phenotype . Accordingly , HB-19 pretreated G401 cells lose the capacity to form colonies in soft agar . When assayed for tumorigenicity in nude mice , only 50% of mice injected with HB-19 pretreated G401 cells developed tumors with the mean tumor weight of 0.32 g , compared to 100% of mice injected with control G401 cells with the mean tumor weight of 2.36 g .

{"sentence": "PURPOSE Mitotic cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation , exhibiting single-hit inactivation coefficients near to those of repair deficient cell lines and lymphocytes . To elucidate possible mechanisms for this hypersensitivity , the kinetics of oxygen radiosensitization , the proportion of indirect effect by OH radicals and the kinetics of radiation-induced DNA strand breakage in the chromatin of mitotic cells were investigated . MATERIALS AND METHODS Synchronized populations of >90% mitotic HT-29 cells were obtained by the mitotic shake-off method . Cells were irradiated at < or =4 degrees C with ( 137)Cs gamma-rays . Cellular oxygen concentration was varied by gassing cell suspensions prior to and during irradiation with mixtures of pure N(2) that contained 5% CO(2) and measured quantities of O(2) . The indirect effect of OH radicals was investigated with the radical scavenger , DMSO . DNA strand breakage was measured by the comet assay . RESULTS Mitotic HT-29 cell inactivation is well described by a single-hit inactivation coefficient ( alpha ) of 1.14 +/- 0.06 Gy(-1) . The oxygen enhancement ratio of mitotic cells ( at 10% survival ) was found to be approximately 2.0 , significantly lower than the value of 2.8 measured for interphase ( asynchronous ) cells . More than 60% of mitotic cell killing was eliminated when the media contained 2 M DMSO , indicating that indirect effect is as important in the killing of mitotic cells as it is for interphase cells . The chromatin in mitotic cells was found to be times more sensitive to radiation-induced DNA single-strand breakage than the chromatin of interphase cells . CONCLUSIONS The alpha-inactivation coefficient of mitotic HT-29 cells was times larger than that of interphase cells . Mitotic cell chromatin appears to contain intrinsic DNA breaks that are not lethal . In addition , chromatin in mitotic cells was found to be more susceptible to radiation-induced DNA strand-breakage than the dispersed chromatin of interphase cells . How the enhanced production of these simple DNA lesions ( that are usually reparable ) translates into the lethal ( non-reparable ) events associated with alpha-inactivation is not known . The compaction/dispersion status of DNA throughout the cell cycle appears to be an important factor for determining intrinsic cell radiosensitivity and might be manipulated for radiotherapeutic advantage .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "12556342"}

Little is known about the synergistic action of growth and inflammatory factors in IBDC metastases . METHODS The expression of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 ( phosphorylated or p-ERK1/2 ) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in IBDC tissue samples from 80 cases . BT474 IBDC cell migration and invasion were quantified using the Transwell assay . Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 expression and activity were analyzed by RT-PCR , Western blotting and zymography . Activator protein ( AP)-1 activity was measured with a luciferase reporter gene assay . The Wilcoxon signed-rank test , Chi-square test , the partition of Chi-square test , independent t-test , and Spearman's method were used for the statistical analysis . RESULTS Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected in 58/80 ( 72.5% ) IBDC tissues , and was associated with higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis , but not patient age or tumor size . Individually , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , and interleukin ( IL)-1\u03b2 activated ERK1/2 , increased cell migration and invasion , MMP-9 expression and activity , AP-1 activation in vitro and the expression of p-ERK1/2 was positively correlated with EGF expression levels , as well as IL-1\u03b2 , MMP-9 and c-fos in IBDC tissue samples . Co-stimulation with EGF and IL-1\u03b2 synergistically increased ERK1/2 and AP-1 activation , cell migration and invasion , and MMP-9 expression and activity .

Male beta-cat KO and age- and sex-matched littermate controls were given a single intraperitoneal DEN injection and followed for 6-12 months for hepatic tumors . Hepatic tumors were characterized for histology , proliferation , apoptosis , oxidative stress , and specific proteins by way of western blot , immunohistochemistry , and coprecipitation studies . For in vivo tumor intervention studies , specific inhibitors were administered intraperitoneally or through drinking water . Intriguingly , beta-cat KO mice showed a paradoxical increase in susceptibility to DEN-induced tumorigenesis . This accelerated tumorigenesis is due to increased injury and inflammation , unrestricted oxidative stress , fibrosis , and compensatory increase in hepatocyte proliferation secondary to platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRalpha)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PIK3CA)/Akt activation and c-Myc overexpression . In vitro suppression of beta-catenin expression in hepatoma cells led to enhanced PDGFRalpha expression , which was abrogated in the presence of nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) inhibitor . Daily treatment of 6-month-old DEN-exposed beta-cat KO with PDGFRalpha inhibitor dramatically reduced tumor numbers and size . Inclusion of N-acetyl-L-cysteine , a known antioxidant and NF-kappaB inhibitor , in the drinking water led to complete abolition of tumorigenesis in DEN-exposed beta-cat KO .

We identified the interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) gene as an RA induced gene in HMEC . Northern blot analyses showed that the IL-1beta gene was up-regulated as early as 2 h after RA treatment . Results from the treatment of HMEC with cycloheximide and actinomycin D indicated that the regulation of the IL-1beta gene by RA occurred at the transcriptional level and that the IL-1beta gene is a direct , downstream target gene of RA .

Either RA or IL-1beta could significantly inhibit the proliferation of HMEC . However , the addition of soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist ( sIL-1ra ) to the cell culture medium did not block RA-induced HMEC growth inhibition , whereas sIL-1ra did block the growth inhibition of HMEC by IL-1beta . IL-1beta expression was not observed in the three carcinoma cell lines , MCF-7 , MDA-MB-231 , and MDA-MB-468 , as compared to the HMEC .

Ultrastructural examination was also performed in two of the cases . RESULTS The patients age ranged from 28 to 62 years ( mean = 43 years ) . The male-to-female ratio was 2:3 . The clinical presentation included nasal obstruction , nasal discharge , nasal bleeding , facial pain , facial swelling , toothache and tear overflow . All of the 5 patients suffered from disease relapses ; and 4 of them had recurrences for more than 5 times . One patient had lymph node metastasis and 3 patients died of the disease . Histologically , the tumor cells were arranged in interlacing fascicles and sometimes haphazard in fashion . They were spindly in shape , cytoplasm eosinophilic with mild nuclear atypia and a low mitotic activity . The intervening stroma was myxoid in appearance accompanied by lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration , abundant blood vessels and focal collagenized areas . In 3 of the recurrent cases , the tumor cells displayed increased nuclear atypia and mitotic activity ( average about 5 to 6 per 10 high-power fields ) , accompanied by patchy necrosis , less inflammatory cell infiltration and focal sarcomatous changes .

We have recently shown that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucose ( PGG ) induced S-phase arrest in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells through inhibiting DNA replicative synthesis and G(1) arrest , in addition to inducing cell death at higher levels of exposure . We and others have shown that PGG through intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection exerts a strong in vivo growth suppression of human PCa xenograft models in athymic nude mice . This study aims to test the hypothesis that the novel targeting actions of PGG are applicable to BCa cells , especially those lacking proven druggable targets . METHODS Mono-layer cell culture models of p53-wild type estrogen receptor ( ER)-dependent MCF-7 BCa cells and p53-mutant ER-/progesterone receptor ( PR)- and Her2-regular ( triple-negative ) MDA-MB-231 BCa were exposed to PGG for a comprehensive investigation of cellular consequences and molecular targets/mediators . To test the in vivo efficacy , female athymic mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 xenograft were treated with 20mg PGG/kg body weight by daily gavage starting 4 days after cancer cell inoculation . RESULTS Exposure to PGG induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines as indicated by the lack of 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine ( BrdU ) incorporation into S-phase cells as well as G(1) arrest . Higher levels of PGG induced more caspase-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 , in strong association with induction of P53 Ser(15) phosphorylation , than in MDA-MB-231 cells . The cell cycle arrests were achieved without an induction of cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitory proteins P21(Cip1) and P27(Kip1) . PGG treatment led to decreased cyclin D1 in both cell lines and over-expressing cyclin D1 attenuated G(1) arrest and hastened S arrest . In serum-starvation synchronized MCF-7 cells , down-regulation of cyclin D1 was associated with de-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein by PGG shortly before G(1)-S transition . In vivo , oral administration of PGG led to a greater than 60% inhibition of MDA-MB231 xenograft growth without adverse effect on host body weight .

For cell seeding numbers ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 , a maximum culture time of 48 h was identified for fibroblasts without significant reduction in cell proliferation due to contact inhibition . Thus , for Cu cytotoxicity assays , a cell seeding density of 50,000 and a maximum culture time of 48 h in 96 well plates were used. 24 h after cell seeding , culture media were replaced with Cu ion containing media solutions of different concentrations , including 24 and 72 h extracts from TCuIUDs and incubated for a further 24 h .

The cytotoxic effects were further evaluated using light microscopy , apoptosis and cell cycle analysis assays . Fibroblasts became rounded and eventually detached from TCP surface due to Cu ion toxicity . A linear increase in apoptotic cell population with increasing Cu ion concentration was observed in the tested range of 0 to 50 \\u03bcg/ml .

METHODS The SHEE cell series consisted of immortalized embryonic esophageal epithelium which was in malignant transformation when cultivated over sixty passages without co-carcinogens . Cells of the 10th , 31st , 60th and 85th passages were present in progressive development after being transfected with HPV . Cells were cultivated in a culture flask and 24-hole cultural plates . Progressive changes of morphology , cell growth , contact-inhibition , and anchorage-dependent growth characteristics were examined by phase contrast microscopy . The cell proliferation rate was assayed by flow cytometry . The modal number of chromosomes was analyzed . HPV18E(6)E(7) was detected by Western blot methods and activities of telomerase were analyzed by TRAP . Tumorigenicity of cells was detected with soft agar plates cultivated and with tumor formation in SCID mice . RESULTS In morphological examination the 10th passage cells were in good differentiation , the 60th and 85th passages cells were in relatively poor differentiation , and the 31st passage cells had two distinct differentiations . The characteristics of the 85th and 60th passage cells were weakened at contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . Karyotypes of four stages of cells belonged to hyperdiploid or hypotriploid , and bimodal distribution of chromosomes appeared in the 31st and 60th passage cells . All of these characteristics combined with a increasing trend . The activities of telomerase were expressed in the latter three passages . Four fourths of SCID mice in the 85th passage cells and one fourth of SCID mice in the 60th passage cells developed tumors , but the cells in the 10th and 31st passage displayed no tumor formation . CONCLUSION In continual cultivation of fetal esophageal epithelial cells with transduction of HPV18E(6)E(7) , cells from the 10th to the 85th passage were changed gradually from preimmortal , immortal , precancerous to malignantly transformed stages .

The changes in the cell cycle and corresponding protein composition of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line after treatment with BOH were evaluated and proteins differentially expressed in the BOH treated A549 cells , compared to the untreated A549 counterparts , were selected . Thirteen of these candidate proteins associated with the drug effects in vitro were identified by mass spectrometry . Many of these proteins fall into one of three functional categories : i ) metabolic pathways ( glycolysis , nucleic acid synthesis and NADPH production ) , ii ) stress response and protein folding , and iii ) cytoskeleton and exocytosis . Changes in protein expression patterns corresponded to a higher resistance of A549 lung carcinoma cells to BOH when compared to the CEM leukaemia cell line . These protein changes reflect a fine balance of the resistant versus the susceptible phenotype in response to the drug .

IGS and IFD differ in that IGS usually presents with proteinuria , which is not observed in IFD . The genetic heterogeneity and numerous differential diagnoses make clinical assessment difficult . METHODS We present a large genetic screening study of 154 families or patients with suspected hereditary Cbl malabsorption . Patients and their families have been accrued over a period spanning >12\\u2009 years . Systematic genetic testing of the three genes CUBN , AMN , and GIF was accomplished using a combination of single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA and RNA sequencing . In addition , six genes that were contenders for a role in inherited Cbl malabsorption were studied in a subset of these patients . RESULTS Our results revealed population-specific mutations , mutational hotspots , and functionally distinct regions in the three causal genes . We identified mutations in 126/154 unrelated cases ( 82% ) . Fifty-three of 126 cases ( 42% ) were mutated in CUBN , 45/126 ( 36% ) were mutated in AMN , and 28/126 ( 22% ) had mutations in GIF .

{"sentence": "INTRODUCTION Anterior-gradient 2 ( AGR2 ) is an estrogen-responsive secreted protein . Its upregulation has been well documented in a number of cancers , particularly breast cancer , for which mixed data exist on the prognostic implications of AGR2 expression . Although emerging evidence indicates that AGR2 is associated with poor prognosis , its function and impact on cancer-relevant pathways have not been elucidated in breast cancer . METHODS To investigate the biologic role of AGR2 in breast cancer , AGR2 was transiently knocked down , by using siRNA , in T47 D and ZR-75-1 ( estrogen receptor-alpha ( ER)-positive ) and MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 ( ER-negative ) human breast cancer cell lines . The impact of silencing AGR2 was evaluated in both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth ( soft agar , spheroid ) assays . Cell-cycle profiles in ER-positive cell lines were determined with BrdU incorporation , and cell death was measured with Annexin V , JC-1 , and F7-26 staining . After transiently silencing AGR2 or stimulating with recombinant AGR2 , modulation of key regulators of growth and survival pathways was assessed with Western blot . Combination studies of AGR2 knockdown with the antiestrogens tamoxifen and fulvestrant were carried out and assessed at the level of anchorage-dependent growth inhibition and target modulation ( cyclin D1 , ER ) . RESULTS AGR2 knockdown inhibited growth in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent assays , with a more-pronounced effect in ER-positive cell lines . Cyclin D1 levels and BrdU incorporation were reduced with AGR2 knockdown . Conversely , cyclin D1 was induced with recombinant AGR2 . AGR2 knockdown induced cell death in ZR-75-1 and T47 D cells , and also downregulated survivin and c-Myc . Evidence of AGR2-ER crosstalk was demonstrated by a reduction of ER at the protein level after transiently silencing AGR2 . AGR2 knockdown in combination with fulvestrant or tamoxifen did not preclude the efficacy of the antiestrogens , but enhanced it . In addition , p-Src , implicated in tamoxifen resistance , was downregulated with AGR2 knockdown . CONCLUSIONS Transiently silencing AGR2 in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines inhibited cell growth and cell-cycle progression and induced cell death . Breast cancer drivers ( ER and cyclin D1 ) as well as cancer-signaling nodes ( pSrc , c-Myc , and survivin ) were demonstrated to be downstream of AGR2 .

To determine whether a preliminary link exists between autophagy and miR-18a , HCT116 cells were irradiated and quantitative ( q ) PCR was performed to measure miR-18a expression . HCT116 cells were transfected with an miR-18a mimic to study its impact on indicators of autophagy . Western blotting and luciferase assays were implemented to explore the impact of miR-18a on ATM gene expression in HCT116 cells . The results showed that miR-18a expression was strongly stimulated by radiation . Ectopic overexpression of miR-18a in HCT116 cell lines potently enhanced autophagy and ionizing radiation-induced autophagy . Moreover , miR-18a overexpression led to the upregulation of ATM expression and suppression of mTORC1 activity .

{"sentence": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC or Lynch syndrome ) , is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that is believed to account for 2-10 per cent of all the colorectal cancer cases . The disease follows autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with high penetrance ( 85% ) and younger age of onset when compared to patients with sporadic tumours . HNPCC is associated with germ-line mutations in the DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) genes namely MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , and PMS2 . The present study was aimed at analyzing mismatch repair gene(s) in an extended Indian family satisfying the Amsterdam criteria , and extending the analysis to general population to estimate frequency of the mutations/polymorphisms observed . METHODS A total 12 members of the HNPCC family were studied for genetic investigation . Ethnically matched 250 normal individuals were also included as controls to study the observed mutations/polymorphisms at population level . RESULTS The analysis resulted in identification of a 1975C>T mutation in exon 17 , resulting in substitution of arginine residue with stop codon at codon 659. 655A>G substitution was also observed , resulting in replacement of isoleucine with valine at codon 219 . Similar analysis on 250 ethnically matched control subjects revealed complete absence of R659X mutation , while I219V variant was found in 9.8 per cent of the controls . INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION R659X mutation correlates with disease phenotype , and 655A>G locus is highly polymorphic . Our study suggested that R659X substitution was prime cause for the disease phenotype in this family . I219V substitution is a polymorphism having no association with the disease onset or segregation .

In glioblastoma cells , the knockdown of coronin 3 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion . Coronin 3 is also associated with the aggression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma . In this paper , we analyze the migration , invasion and metastasis abilities of gastric cancer cells after up- or down-regulation of coronin 3 , and explore the mechanism of coronin 3 in the process of gastric cancer metastasis . RESULTS The expression of coronin 3 was higher in the highly metastatic sub-cell line MKN28-M , which we established in our laboratory . We also demonstrated that the expression of coronin 3 was remarkably higher in lymph lode metastases than in primary gastric cancer tissues , and over-expression of coronin 3 was correlated with the increased clinical stage and lymph lode metastasis . Recombinant lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs were designed to down-regulate coronin 3 expression in gastric cancer cell lines . Stable knockdown of coronin 3 by this lentiviral vector could efficiently inhibit the migration and invasion of MKN45 gastric cancer cells . In contrast , up-regulation of coronin 3 significantly enhanced migration and invasion of MKN28-NM cells . In addition , knockdown of coronin 3 significantly reduced liver metastasis in mice after tail vein injection of gastric cancer cells . The Human Tumor Metastasis PCR Array was used to screen the metastasis-associated genes identified by the down-regulation of coronin 3 , and the results suggested that , following the knockdown of coronin 3 , the tumor cell migration and invasion were inhibited by the reduced expression of MMP-9 and cathepsin K.

It evinced more potent cytotoxicity toward estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells than ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells . Further study disclosed that marmorin undermined the expression level of estrogen receptor \u03b1 ( ER\u03b1 ) and significantly inhibited the proliferation of MCF7 cells induced by 17\u03b2-estradiol . Knockdown of ER\u03b1 in MCF7 cells significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of marmorin on proliferation , suggesting that the ER\u03b1-mediated pathway was implicated in the suppressive action of marmorin on ER-positive breast cancer cells . Moreover , marmorin induced time-dependent apoptosis in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells .

The overproduction of these cytokines plays an important role in cancer . The aim of this work was to design a peptide inhibitor on the basis of structural information of the active site of p38\u03b1 . METHODS : A tetrapeptide , VWCS as p38\u03b1 inhibitor was designed on the basis of structural information of the ATP binding site by molecular modeling . The inhibition study of peptide with p38\u03b1 was performed by ELISA , binding study by Surface Plasmon Resonance and anti-proliferative assays by MTT and flow cytometry . RESULTS : The percentage inhibition of designed VWCS against pure p38\u03b1 protein and serum of HNSCC patients was 70.30 and 71.5% , respectively . The biochemical assay demonstrated the K(D) and IC(50) of the selective peptide as 7.22\ufffd10(-9)M and 20.08nM , respectively . The VWCS as inhibitor significantly reduced viability of oral cancer KB cell line with an IC(50) value of 10\u03bcM and induced apoptosis by activating Caspase 3 and 7 . CONCLUSIONS : VWCS efficiently interacted at the ATP binding pocket of p38\u03b1 with high potency and can be used as a potent inhibitor in case of HNSCC . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE : VWCS can act as an anticancer agent as it potentially inhibits the cell growth and induces apoptosis in oral cancer cell-line in a dose as well as time dependent manner .

However , the role of hypoxia in regulating CXCR4 in gastric cancer remains poorly understood . KATO III gastric cancer cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia . CXCR4 expression in cells transfected with shRNA specific for HIF-1\u03b1 was investigated by western blotting and flow cytometry . Wound healing , migration and invasion assays were used to assess cell motility and the chemotactic response to CXCL12 , a major CXCR4 ligand .

This upregulation of CXCR4 was implicated in increased cell motility and enhanced chemotactic responses ( migration and invasion ) to CXCL12 treatment in vitro . The increases in CXCR4 expression and metastatic potential in gastric cancer cells exposed to hypoxia were blocked by HIF-1\u03b1-specific shRNA .

Periplocin inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and induced their apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manners by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase . Periplocin exhibited anti-tumor activity both in human ( A549 ) and mouse ( LL/2 ) lung cancer xenograft models .

In this study , the effect of capsaicin on proliferation and apoptosis in the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 and its possible mechanism(s) of action were investigated . The results of a Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay revealed that capsaicin significantly decreased the viability of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner . Capsaicin induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PANC-1 cells as demonstrated by a flow cytometric assessment . Caspase-3 expression at both the protein and mRNA level was promoted following capsaicin treatment . Furthermore , we revealed that phospho-PI3 Kinase p85 ( Tyr458 ) and phospho-Akt ( Ser473 ) in PANC-1 cells were downregulated in response to capsaicin . Moreover , capsaicin gavage significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell xenografts in athymic nude mice . An increased number of TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 were observed in capsaicin-treated mice . In vivo , capsaicin downregulated the expression of phospho-PI3 Kinase p85 ( Tyr458 ) and phospho-Akt ( Ser473 ) .

Cell-contact and soluble factors are demonstrated to play a role in the growth inhibition of tumor cells mediated by MSCs in vitro , while there is little clue about signaling pathways involved in the process . P38 MAPK has been implicated as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis . We here investigate whether p38 MAPK is involved in MSC-induced growth inhibition of leukemic tumor cells . Methods : We characterized the effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ( UC-MSCs ) on proliferation , cell cycle and phosphorylation pattern of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells . SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK , or p38 MAPK-small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , were used to identify the role of p38 in growth suppression by UC-MSCs . We also investigated the expression of cell cycle regulators . RESULTS Treatment with UC-MSCs led to potent proliferation-inhibition of HL60 and K562 cells without inducing apoptosis . Growth inhibition by UC-MSCs was due to G0/G1 arrest . UC-MSCs increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells . Pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing ( through siRNA ) of p38 MAPK partially abrogated the proliferation-suppression and cell cycle arrest caused by UC-MSCs . UC-MSCs also modulated the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in HL60 and K562 cells while SB203580 reversed the effect .

By combining tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) with arginine deprivation using ADI-PEG20 ( pegylated arginine deiminase ) , we achieved enhanced apoptosis and accelerated cell death in melanoma cell lines . This implies a switch from autophagy to apoptosis . In our current investigation , we found that TRAIL could induce the cleavage of two key autophagic proteins , Beclin-1 and Atg5 , in the combination treatment . Using specific inhibitors for individual caspases , we found that caspase-8 inhibitor could completely abolish the cleavage . Furthermore , caspase-8 inhibitor was able to fully reverse the enhanced cytotoxicity induced by TRAIL . Inhibitors for caspase-3 , 6 , 9 , and 10 were able to block the cleavage of these two autophagic proteins to some extent and correspondingly rescue cells from the cytotoxicity of the combination of TRAIL and arginine deprivation . In contrast , calpain inhibitor could not prevent the cleavage of either Beclin-1 or Atg5 , and was unable to prevent cell death .

Flow cytometric analysis showed that the cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase .

{"sentence": "PURPOSE Current antibody-based immunotherapeutic approaches under evaluation for breast carcinoma are limited in target scope . For example , administration of the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antibody , alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic drug , is thought to primarily inhibit tumor cell proliferation . The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a combined blockade designed to inhibit tumor growth by inhibition of proliferation rate and the proinflammatory effects of interleukin ( IL ) 8 . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A human breast carcinoma cell line that produces high levels of IL-8 was injected s.c. into severe combined immunodeficient mice . IL-8 has been reported to augment the progression of some human tumors ; thus , we used a human IL-8 antibody , ABXIL8 , in combination with anti-EGFR , ABXEGFR , to inhibit the metastasis of MDA231 tumors . RESULTS Whereas anti-IL-8 alone had no appreciable antimetastatic effect , the combination of ABXIL8 significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of ABXEGFR , resulting in greater survival of SCID tumor-bearing mice . This effect on survival was correlated with decreased metastatic spread and decreased tumor size in mice receiving both antibodies . Intriguingly , in vitro studies indicate that this antibody combination markedly inhibited matrix metalloproteinase activity associated with MDA-231 cells to a greater degree than either antibody alone . CONCLUSION Combined administration of these two human antibodies using growth factor blockade in conjunction with chemokine blockade may thus provide a more effective approach for treatment of metastatic human breast carcinoma .", "label": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "12171898"}

RESULTS Immunoreactivity of MMP-1 , -2 , and -3 was observed in small cancer nests of the deeply invasive or marginal portion of the tumor . Among the 29 patients studied , the presence of at least one MMP was observed in 17 ( 58.6% ) . All three enzymes were observed in six ( 20.6% ) patients , MMP-2 and -3 in five ( 17.2% ) patients , only MMP-2 in three ( 10.3% ) patients , and MMP-3 alone in three ( 10.3% ) patients . There was a good correlation among histologic stage and tumor invasion , lymph node metastasis , and MMP expression . In particular , expression of MMP-2 and -3 was closely related to lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion .

{"sentence": "Calcium ( Ca(2+) ) signals are involved in important checkpoints in cell death pathways and promote both apoptosis and autophagy . However , the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in response to Ca(2+) level elevation is poorly understood . Here , we provided evidence that the influx of extracellular Ca(2+) triggered by Trichokonin VI ( TK VI ) , an antimicrobial peptide , induced calpain-dependent apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells . Remarkably , TK VI preferentially induced apoptosis that was associated with calpain-mediated Bax and Atg5 cleavage , which resulted in the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release . Interestingly , truncated , but not full-length Atg5 , associated with Bcl-xL and promoted the intrinsic pathway . Moreover , TK VI treatment induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) accumulation , an effect in which Bak might play a major role . This accumulation of ROS resulted in the subsequent disposal of damaged mitochondria within autophagosomes via Atg5-mediated and mitochondria-selective autophagy . Both the inhibition of calpain activity and Bax deficiency activated a switch that promoted an enhancement of autophagy . The inhibition of both apoptosis and autophagy significantly attenuated the TK VI cytotoxicity , indicating that the two processes had stimulatory effects during TK VI-meditated cell death . These results suggested that calpain , Bak and Atg5 were molecular links between autophagy and apoptosis and revealed novel aspects of the crosstalk between these two processes .

RESULTS Phenylglyoxal induced cellular DNA damage and formation of high levels of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes in cells .

{"sentence": "During tumorigenesis , cells acquire immortality in association with the development of genomic instability . However , it is still elusive how genomic instability spontaneously generates during the process of tumorigenesis . Here , we show that precancerous DNA lesions induced by oncogene acceleration , which induce situations identical to the initial stages of cancer development , trigger tetraploidy/aneuploidy generation in association with mitotic aberration . Although oncogene acceleration primarily induces DNA replication stress and the resulting lesions in the S phase , these lesions are carried over into the M phase and cause cytokinesis failure and genomic instability . Unlike directly induced DNA double-strand breaks , DNA replication stress-associated lesions are cryptogenic and pass through cell-cycle checkpoints due to limited and ineffective activation of checkpoint factors . Furthermore , since damaged M-phase cells still progress in mitotic steps , these cells result in chromosomal mis-segregation , cytokinesis failure and the resulting tetraploidy generation . Thus , our results reveal a process of genomic instability generation triggered by precancerous DNA replication stress .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "20098673"}

We used a biological activity-guided fractionation approach to isolate the most potent fraction of the crude extract on three cancer cell lines : MCF-7 oestrogen-dependent breast cancer , MDA-MB-468 oestrogen-independent breast cancer , and Caco-2 colon cancer cells . A series of chromatographic and spectroscopic procedures were utilised on the EtOAc fraction , which resulted in the isolation of a new steroidal saponin glycoside . The cytotoxic activity of the saponin glycoside was determined in cancer cells using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays . After 24h treatment , the observed IC(50) values of the saponin glycoside were 12.5 \u03bcM on MDA-MB-468 and Caco-2 cells , but 100 \u03bcM on MCF-7 cells . Several lines of evidence : PARP cleavage , caspase-3 cleavage , DNA ladder assays , and reversal of growth inhibition with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk , suggested stimulation of apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and Caco-2 cells , but not in MCF-7 cells , which do not express caspase-3 . The haemolytic activity of the saponin glycoside was confirmed in sheep red blood cells , with cell lysis observed at >100 \u03bcM , suggesting that , at this concentration , the saponin glycoside caused necrosis through cell lysis in MCF-7 cells . Using the DNA ladder assay , the saponin glycoside ( 12.5 \u03bcM ) was not toxic to HUVEC ( human umbilical vein endothelial cells ) or U937 cells , indicating some selectivity between malignant and normal cells .

There was a significant association between p16 cytoplasmic expression and prostate cancer survival ( HR\u2009=\u20092.52 , 95%CI\u2009= 1.79-3.55 , p\u2009<\u20090.001 ) and overall survival ( HR\u2009= 1.54 , 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.20-1.98 , p\u2009=\u20090.001 ) in a univariate model. p16 expression remained an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer survival ( HR\u2009=\u20091.50 , 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.05-2.14 , p\u2009=\u20090.03 ) . CONCLUSION We conclude that p16 cytoplasmic expression can be used as a predictor of outcome in conservatively treated prostate cancer . Rb and p21 show no independent association with outcome and therefore further research is not warranted .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "20854069"}

In T-HME cells , the expression of two p53 regulated genes p21(WAF) and HDM2 increased ( as in primary senescent HME cells ) , and was found to be further elevated as the function of p53 was activated by treatment with DNA-damaging agents. p16(INK4a) was shown to be significantly higher in the primary senescent HME and the early passage T-HME cells when compared with the primary presenescent HME cells , with a dramatic repression of p16(INK4a) observed in the later passage T-HME cells . In addition , the expression of E2F1 and its transcription factor activity were found to be significantly higher in the later passage T-HME cells when compared with the earlier passage T-HME cells .

Phenotypic changes , chromosomal aberrations , centrosome number , and telomerase activity were assayed in control uncultured cells and in three subsequent stages of transformation . Supernumerary centrosomes , binucleate cells , and tetraploidy were observed as early as 48 hr after explantation . In addition , telomerase activity increased throughout progression .

Cell proliferation was evaluated using the Invitrogen Alarmar Blue assay . Gene expression was analyzed using the Invitrogen SYBR Green expression assays with a sequence detection system . Protein expression analysis was performed using Western blotting . RESULTS Sorafenib potently suppressed the activities of cRAF , VEGFR2 , and RET with IC(50) values of 20.9 , 4 and 0.4 nmol/L , respectively .

METHODS We examined the systemic influence ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) exerted on levels of peripheral blood DCs and inflammatory mediators in comparison to the effects exerted by other pancreatic tumors , chronic pancreatitis , and age-matched controls . RESULTS All groups examined , including PDAC , had decreased levels of myeloid DCs ( MDC ) and plasmacytoid DCs ( PDC ) and enhanced apoptosis in these cells as compared to controls . We found elevated levels of PGE2 and CXCL8 in subjects with PDAC , and chronic pancreatitis . Levels of these inflammatory factors were in part restored in PDAC after tumor resection , whereas the levels of DCs were impaired in the majority of these patients approximately 12 weeks after tumor removal . Our results prove that solid pancreatic tumors , including PDAC , systemically affect blood DCs . The impairments do not seem to be tumor-specific , since similar results were obtained in subjects with chronic pancreatitis . Furthermore , we found that PDAC patients with a survival over 2 years had significant higher levels of blood DCs compared to patients with less than one year survival .

In this paper we present a comprehensive EST assembly derived from diploid and model allotetraploid cottons and demonstrate several evolutionary inferences regarding genic evolution that can be drawn from these data . RESULTS We generated a set of cotton expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) , comprising approximately 4.4 million Sanger and next-generation ( 454 ) transcripts supplemented by approximately 152 million Illumina reads from diploid and allotetraploid cottons . From the EST alignments we inferred 259,192 genome-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) . Molecular evolutionary analyses of protein-coding regions demonstrate that the rate of nucleotide substitution has increased among both allotetraploid genomes relative to the diploids , and that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions has increased in one of the two polyploid lineages we sampled .

RESULTS Human hepatoma cells infected with HCV JFH-1 showed 30-60-fold increases in ROS levels compared to uninfected cells . Levels of the oxidatively modified guanosine base 8-oxoguanine ( 8-oxoG ) were significantly increased sixfold in the HCV-infected cells . Because DNA glycosylases are the enzymes that remove oxidized nucleotides , their expression in HCV-infected cells was analyzed . NEIL1 but not OGG1 or NEIL2 gene expression was impaired in HCV-infected cells . In accordance , we found reduced glycosylase ( NEIL1-specific ) activity in HCV-infected cells . The antioxidant N-acetyl cystein ( NAC ) efficiently reversed the NEIL1 repression by inhibiting ROS induction by HCV . NEIL1 expression was also partly restored when virus-infected cells were treated with interferon ( IFN ) . HCV core and to a lesser extent NS3-4a and NS5A induced ROS , and downregulated NEIL1 expression . Liver biopsy specimens showed significant impairment of NEIL1 levels in HCV-infected patients with advanced liver disease compared to patients with no disease . CONCLUSION Collectively , the data indicate that HCV induction of ROS and perturbation of NEIL1 expression may be mechanistically involved in progression of liver disease and suggest that antioxidant and antiviral therapies can reverse these deleterious effects of HCV in part by restoring function of the DNA repair enzyme/s .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], "id": "20074151"}

Previous studies have reported expression of PKC\u025b in breast , prostate and lung tumors above that of normal adjacent tissue . Data from the cancer genome atlas suggest increased copy number of PRKCE in triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . We find that overexpression of PKC\u025b in a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition and results in the formation of cellular foci . Correspondingly , inhibition of PKC\u025b in a TNBC cell model results in growth defects in two-dimensional ( 2D ) and three-dimensional ( 3D ) culture conditions and orthotopic xenografts . Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in a cell culture phosphoproteomic approach , we find that CTNND1/p120ctn phosphorylation at serine 268 ( P-S268 ) occurs in a strictly PKC\u025b-dependent manner , and that loss of PKC\u025b signaling in TNBC cells leads to reversal of mesenchymal morphology and signaling . In a model of Ras activation , inhibition of PKC\u025b is sufficient to block mesenchymal cell morphology . Finally , treatment with a PKC\u025b ATP mimetic inhibitor , PF-5263555 , recapitulates genetic loss of function experiments impairing p120ctn phosphorylation as well as compromising TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo .

PML-NB fail to form normally , and promyelocytes remain in an undifferentiated , abnormally proliferative state . We examined the involvement of PML protein and PML-NB in homologous recombinational repair ( HRR ) of chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks . Transient overexpression of wild-type PML protein isoforms produced hugely enlarged or aggregated PML-NB and reduced HRR by suggesting that HRR depends to some extent upon normal PML-NB structure . Knockdown of PML by RNA interference sharply attenuated formation of PML-NB and reduced HRR by up to 20-fold . However , PML-knockdown cells showed apparently normal induction of H2AX phosphorylation and RAD51 foci after DNA damage by ionizing radiation . These findings indicate that early steps in HRR , including recognition of DNA double-strand breaks , initial processing of ends , and assembly of single-stranded DNA/RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments , do not depend upon PML-NB . The HRR deficit in PML-depleted cells thus reflects inhibition of later steps in the repair pathway .

The expression of AKT , mTOR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) proteins was evaluated using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples in different phases of HA . AKT/mTOR pathway was blocked by recombinant small hairpin RNA adenovirus vector rAd5-AKT+mTOR ( rAd5-Am ) , used for infecting proliferating phase HA-derived endothelial cells ( HDEC ) . The expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA was detected by Real-time PCR and Western blot assays .

As a consequence , the expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA was significantly increased in proliferative phase HA , while that was decreased in involutive phase . Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway by rAd5-Am diminished cell proliferative activities , and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest with the decreased expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA in proliferative phase HDEC .

The effect of CCK-BR downregulation in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was examined by utilizing specific CCK-BR-targeted RNA interference reagents . The CCK-BR receptor expression was both transiently and stably downregulated by transfection with selective CCK-BR small-interfering RNA or short-hairpin RNA , respectively , and the effects on cell growth and apoptosis were assessed .

Epigenetic silencing of the THRB gene is common in human cancers . The aim of the present study was to determine how DNA methylation affected the expression of the THRB gene in differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) and how reexpression of the THRB gene attenuated the cancer phenotypes . We used methylation-specific PCR to examine the expression and promoter methylation of the THRB gene in DTC tissues . Thyroid cancer cells with hypermethylated THRB were treated with the demethylating agents 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5'-aza-CdR ) and zebularine to evaluate their impact on the cancer cell phenotypes . THRB mRNA expression in DTC was 90% lower than in normal controls , and this decrease was associated with a higher tumor/lymph node staging . The promoter methylation level of the THRB gene had a significant negative correlation with the expression level of the THRB gene . Treatment of FTC-236 cells with 5'-aza-CdR or zebularine induced reexpression of the THRB gene and inhibited cell proliferation and migration . FTC-236 cells stably expressing TR\u03b2 exhibited lower cell proliferation and migration through inhibition of \u03b2-catenin signaling pathways compared with FTC-236 without TR\u03b2. 5'-Aza-CdR also led to suppression of tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model using FTC-236 cells consistent with the cell-based studies .

However , they should also be suited to examine the validity and reliability of molecular cytogenetic techniques in detecting genomic alterations in neoplastic cells . Therefore , comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) and 24-color-fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization ( M-FISH ) were applied to eight sublines of CCRF-CEM leukemia cells selected in vitro for drug resistance and to their drug-sensitive parental counterparts . All cell lines were characterized by altered chromosome numbers and by a variety of chromosomal structural aberrations as shown by M-FISH . The great majority of anomalies detected by this technique were confirmed by CGH . Interestingly , a considerable number of the rearrangements found were imbalanced . Amplifications of 5q13 in the six methotrexate-resistant cell lines , a del(9)(p21pter) in all lines examined , and a gain of chromosome 20 in 9 of the 10 lines examined were readily detected by both techniques . The same held true for losses of chromosomes 17 and 18 in the near tetraploid cell lines which could also be confirmed by CGH . Some imbalances of genomic material detected by CGH were , however , not observed by means of M-FISH , possibly due to the limited extension of the corresponding chromosomal segment involved or the small subpopulation of cells affected . On the other hand , reciprocal translocations , balanced isochromosomes , and small deletions remained mainly undetected by CGH . A comparison of chromosomal alterations in drug-resistant and parental cell lines showed not only amplifications of chromosomal segments harboring well-known drug resistance genes , e.g. , the dihydrofolate reductase gene , but also chromosomal changes which may involve novel genes associated with drug resistance .

QPs were predicted to form stems of self-homology , separated by 3-9 bases of intervening sequences . Analysis of DNA synthesis progression by human Pol \\u03b4 demonstrated significant synthesis perturbation both at [ A](n) and [ TA](n) repeats in a length-dependent manner and at short ( <40 base pairs ) QP sequences . DNA synthesis by the Y-family polymerase \\u03ba was significantly more efficient than Pol \\u03b4 through both types of repetitive elements . Using DNA trap experiments , we show that Pol \\u03b4 pauses within CFS sequences are sites of enzyme dissociation , and dissociation was observed in the presence of RFC-loaded PCNA . We propose that enrichment of microsatellite and QP elements at CFS regions contributes to fragility by perturbing replication through multiple mechanisms , including replicative Pol pausing and dissociation .

Skeletal muscle biopsies and muscle microdialysates were obtained from the vastus lateralis before , during and after acute exercise performed at either moderate or high intensity . Comparison of the response in angiogenic factors to acute moderate- versus high-intensity exercise , performed prior to the intense training intervention , revealed that intense exercise resulted in a markedly lower ( P < 0.05 ) increase in interstitial vascular endothelial growth factor than did moderate-intensity exercise . Muscle interstitial fluid obtained during moderate-intensity exercise increased endothelial cell proliferation in vitro more than interstitial fluid obtained during intense exercise ( sixfold versus 2.5-fold , respectively ; P < 0.05 ) . The 4 weeks of high-intensity training did not lead to an increased capillarization in the muscle but abolished the exercise-induced increase in mRNA for several angiogenic factors , increased the protein levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , lowered the protein levels of thrombospondin-1 in muscle but increased the interstitial protein levels of thrombospondin-1 .

PURPOSE AND METHODS To test this hypothesis , we isolated rat ovarian surface epithelial cells from 10 adult female Fisher rats , initiated two mixed-population and seven clonal cell lines , and repeatedly subcultured these cells in vitro for more than 20 passages . We then tested them for the acquisition of the following four features associated with transformation : 1 ) the loss of contact inhibition , 2 ) the capacity for substrate-independent growth , 3 ) the ability to form tumors when injected subcutaneously and/or intraperitoneally into athymic mice , and 4 ) cytogenetic abnormalities . RESULTS Loss of contact inhibition was observed in all nine late-passage cell lines . Six of the nine late-passage , but none of the early-passage , cell lines tested exhibited a capacity for substrate-independent growth that was augmented in a dose-dependent manner by epidermal growth factor . Two late-passage cell lines ( clone 2 and mixed-population 2 ) generated tumors in athymic BALB/c mice within 3 weeks following subcutaneous injection of 5 x 10(6) cells , whereas similar numbers of early-passage cells from the same cell lines failed to generate palpable tumors . Late-passage clone 7 cells were tumorigenic when 5 x 10(7) cells were injected intraperitoneally . Two of the cell lines analyzed exhibited alterations involving losses of part or all of one member of the chromosome 5 pair . Clone 2 possessed an interstitial deletion , del(5)(q21.3q24) , consistent with the loss of an uncloned putative tumor suppressor gene at 5q22q23 previously reported to reside near the loci for the interferon alpha , interferon beta , and c-jun genes . Early-passage clone 7 cells exhibited chromosome 5 monosomy , while late-passage cells contained one normal chromosome 5 and a derivative ( 5q12q ) . Southern analysis of the three cell lines revealed no consistent loss of loci for the interferon and c-jun genes , although early-passage clone 7 cells had one half the gene copy number for the interferon beta and c-jun genes and both early- and late-passage clone 7 cells lacked DNA sequences hybridizing with the probe for interferon alpha .

Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were obtained from various clinical samples and were then evaluated with agar screening , disk diffusion , and MIC methods to determine resistance to vancomycin and methicillin . After confirmation of the isolated VRSA strain , genetic analysis was performed by evaluating mecA and vanA gene presence , SCCmec , agr , and spa types , and toxin profiles . Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST ) and plasmid analysis were also performed . The VRSA strain was resistant to oxacillin ( MIC of 128 \\u03bcg/ml ) and vancomycin ( MIC of 512 \\u03bcg/ml ) . Disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance to oxacillin , vancomycin , levofloxacin , ciprofloxacin , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , clindamycin , rifampin , and tetracycline . The isolate was susceptible to minocycline and gentamicin . PCRs were positive for the mecA and vanA genes . Other genetic characteristics include SCCmec type III , agr I , spa type t037 , and sequence type ( ST ) 1283 . The plasmid profile shows five plasmids with a size of kb to >10 kb . The isolated VRSA strain was obtained from a critically ill hospitalized patient . Genetic analysis of this strain suggested that the strain was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) clone endemic in Asia that underwent some genetic changes , such as mutation in the gmk gene and acquisition of the vanA gene .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "22933598"}

Thereafter , both PBMC cultures were maintained on rIL-2 up to 20 days . PBMC proliferation was enhanced 17-fold in number by day 20 when anti-CD3 mAb and rIL-2 was present during the first 48 hours but only 3-fold by day 20 when rIL-2 alone was present . Concomitantly anti-CD3 mAb but not Lym-1 , an isotype matched control , inhibited the induction of lytic activity against both NK sensitive ( K562 ) and NK resistant ( Raji ) target cell lines . Thus the inhibitory effect is dependent on anti-CD3 mAb stimulating the CD3/TCR T-cell receptor complex . While lytic activity was dependent on the concentration of rIL-2 , inhibition of the induction phase of non-MHC restricted lytic activity was independent of the concentration of rIL-2 . Flow cytometry analysis indicated that treatment with the anti-CD3 mAb increased the percentage of CD3 positive cells , CD4 positive cells and especially CD25 positive cells , but decreased th percentage of CD56 positive cells . Supernatants from anti-CD3 mAb stimulated cultures also inhibited the induction of non-MHC restricted lytic activity . Lymphokine analysis showed that supernatants of anti-CD3 mAb stimulated cultures had higher levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma .

Hoechst 33342/PI double staining was used to observe apoptosis and ( or ) necrosis that were quantified by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI double staining . Apoptotic pathway was tested by activities of Caspase-3 , Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 . In addition , the expression of NF-kappa B and Cyt-c was measured by immunocytochemistry . RESULTS Cell viabilities were significantly decreased with the increasing concentrations of Al ( P < 0.05 ) , which could be significantly upregulated by 60 micromol/L Nec-1 ( P < 0.05 ) and were correlated with the concentrations of Nec-1 ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) . Apoptosis and necrosis were observed under fluorescent microscope and quantified by flow cytometry , which suggested an increasing trend of apoptotic and necrotic rates ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) .

For example , induction of either p21 or p16 arrests the cell cycle without inhibiting mTOR , which , in turn , converts p21/p16-induced arrest into senescence ( geroconversion ) . Here we show that geroconversion is accompanied by dramatic accumulation of cyclin D1 followed by cyclin E and replicative stress .

In the present study inhibition of furin was achieved by gene transfer of alpha(1)-antitrypsin Portland ( PDX ) cDNA . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This furin inhibitor was transfected into two tumorigenic astrocytoma cell lines . The inhibitory effect was evaluated using in vivo tumorigenicity , invasion , and proliferation assays , as well as by investigating impairment of furin substrate processing . RESULTS Expression of PDX prevented the s.c. growth of the transfected cells . Invasion assays demonstrated that PDX-transfected cells exhibited a reduced invasive ability in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore , s.c. growth of PDX transfectant xenotransplants showed a significant reduction in size that coincided with a significant decrease of the in vitro doubling time and of the in vivo cell proliferation ability .

We have shown previously that a p.o.-active , long-acting butyrate analogue , sodium phenylbutyrate ( PB ) , reduced proliferation in normal and malignant human breast cells in culture and reduced expression of ovarian hormone receptors , suggesting that PB had cellular effects consistent with decreasing breast cancer risk . The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo effects of PB in the normal mammary gland on epithelial cell proliferation , estrogen receptor alpha ( ER alpha ) expression , and cyclin D1 expression . BALB/c mice were treated with PB , delivered by mini-osmotic pumps , for 7 days . Moderate ( 250 mg/kg/day ) and high ( 500 mg/kg/day ) PB treatment resulted in a decrease in proliferation in mammary epithelial cells ( P < 0.001 ) , determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation . Analysis of ER alpha immunostaining revealed a significant reduction in moderate- and high-treatment groups ( P = 0.01 and P = 0.02 ) , and expression of cyclin D1 was virtually ablated ( P < 0.001 ) . Histone deacetylase inhibition is a known mechanism of butyrate action , and consistent with this , PB increased levels of acetylated histone H3 in the mammary gland . In summary , PB decreased proliferation in the mammary gland in vivo at clinically achievable doses . Decreased proliferation was accompanied by changes in the levels of ER alpha and cyclin D1 . These data show that PB modulates parameters thought to be involved in the carcinogenic process in the normal mammary gland , and compounds in this class may therefore be useful candidates for breast cancer chemoprevention .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "id": "12481425"}

Therefore , the present study examined the molecular mechanism of the antiproliferative effects of Compound C. Although Compound C inhibited serum-induced phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate , glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 , it did not affect the Akt activity in vitro . Compound C significantly inhibited the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the activity of downstream signaling molecules , such as p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase , phospholipase C-\u03b31 , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 , induced by platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) but not by epidermal growth factor- and insulin-like growth factor . In vitro growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity profiling revealed the IC(50) for PDGF receptor-\u03b2 ( PDGFR\u03b2 ) to be 5.07 \u03bcM , whereas the IC(50) for the epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor was \u2265100 \u03bcM .

In this study we found that AIB1 protein was frequently overexpressed in human CCA specimens and CCA cell lines . Down-regulation of AIB1 induced the G2/M arrest and decreased the expression of mitosis-promoting factors including Cyclin A , Cyclin B , and Cdk1 through suppressing the Akt pathway , which resulted in inhibiting CCA cell proliferation . In addition , AIB1 enhanced the chemoresistance of CCA cells at least in part through up-regulating the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 . AIB1 regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in CCA cells through activating the Akt pathway as well as suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .

To understand the contribution of miR-183 to the pathogenesis of this aggressive subtype of medulloblastoma , we analyzed global gene expression and proteomic changes that occur upon modulation of miRNAs in this cluster individually and as a group in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma cells . Knockdown of the full miR-183 cluster results in enrichment of genes associated with apoptosis and dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis . Conversely , there is a relative enrichment of pathways associated with migration , metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition , as well as pathways associated with dysfunction of DNA repair in cells with preserved miR-183 cluster expression .

Thirty-six patients from the 57 cases of NPC and 36 healthy controls were investigated to examine the level of serum 8-OHdG , using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . The statistical differences were analyzed using a t test . Strong DNA lesions were observed in the cancer cells of NPC patients . All cases of NPC were positive for 8-NitroG and 8-OHdG , and 54 ( 94.7% ) were positive for iNOS . NPC samples exhibited significantly more intense staining for 8-NitroG , 8-OHdG and iNOS than those of chronic nasopharyngitis ( P < 0.05 , respectively ) .

Maternal diet was estimated through food-frequency questionnaires . RESULTS Both acrylamide and glycidamide Hb adducts were associated with a statistically significant reduction in birth weight and head circumference . The estimated difference in birth weight for infants in the highest versus lowest quartile of acrylamide Hb adduct levels after adjusting for gestational age and country was -132 g ( 95% CI : -207 , -56 ) ; the corresponding difference for head circumference was -0.33 cm ( 95% CI : -0.61 , -0.06 ) .

RESULTS miR-196a was highly expressed both in NSCLC samples and cell lines compared with their corresponding normal counterparts , and the expression of miR-196a may be affected by DNA demethylation . Higher expression of miR-196a in NSCLC tissues was associated with a higher clinical stage , and also correlated with NSCLC lymph-node metastasis . In vitro functional assays demonstrated that modulation of miR-196a expression affected NSCLC cell proliferation , migration and invasion . Our analysis showed that miR-196a suppressed the expression of HOXA5 both at the mRNA and protein levels , and luciferase assays confirmed that miR-196a directly bound to the 3'untranslated region of HOXA5 . Knockdown of HOXA5 expression in A549 cells using RNAi was shown to promote NSCLC cell proliferation , migration and invasion . Finally , we observed an inverse correlation between HOXA5 and miR-196a expression in NSCLC tissues . CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that miR-196a is significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissues , and regulates NSCLC cell proliferation , migration and invasion , partially via the down-regulation of HOXA5 . Thus , miR-196a may represent a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC intervention .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "22876840"}

The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional WGDs compared to mammals , one ( 3R ) at the base of the teleost radiation and another ( 4R ) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids . We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein ( fabp ) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following WGDs . As previously described for zebrafish , we identified two copies ( fabp7a and fabp7b ) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt , but there was only a single transcript in northern pike , the closest relative of the salmonids , and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon , rainbow trout and grayling . A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt , and that the 4R WGD then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids . This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes . There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on dN/dS ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions . Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike . However , only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII , like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish , was expressed in the liver . A comparison of upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII . The presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in this insertion sequence may explain the differential expression of the fabp7b gene duplicates in Atlantic salmon liver .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "22575613"}

METHODS AND MATERIALS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells were treated in vitro for 24 h with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) , then exposed to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( 10 mM ) for 5 min . Immunoblots were screened for EGFR expression and the ability of IMC-C225 to block EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR . Cells were treated with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) on Day 0 , the IC(50) dose of gemcitabine on Day 1 for 24 h , followed by 3 Gy 60Co irradiation on Day 2 , or the combination of each agent . For cell proliferation , cells were counted on Day 4 , and for apoptosis , cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide , then analyzed by FACS . Cells were treated with the same single or multiple treatments and analyzed in a clonogenic cell survival assay . The effect of IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation on the growth of BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 tumor xenografts was determined . Athymic nude mice bearing established s.c. tumor xenografts of 6-8 mm diameter received 6 weeks of treatment with IMC-C225 ( 1 mg every 3 days x 6 ) alone or in combination with gemcitabine ( 120 mg/kg i.v. every 6 days x 6 ) , and 6 weekly fractions of 3 Gy radiation on the days after gemcitabine administration . Tumor growth was measured with Vernier calipers . RESULTS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines expressed low levels of EGFR . IMC-C225 inhibited EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on both cell lines . Treatment of cells with a combination of IMC-C225 + gemcitabine + radiation produced the highest induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in vitro . Combination treatment with IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation produced 100% complete regression of MiaPaCa-2 tumors for more than 250 days , and the greatest growth inhibition of BxPC-3 tumors compared to any single or dual treatments .

Additionally , APC was analyzed using direct sequencing . RESULTS APC mutations were more frequent in polypoid adenomas compared to flat adenomas ( 48.5% versus 30.3% , respectively , p\\u200a=\\u200a0.02 ) .

We observed that induction of graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) significantly reduced the abundance of luc(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T ( Treg ) cells in the tumour tissue , which is indicative of impaired or over-ridden tumour recruitment signals towards Treg cells .

Senescence was evaluated based on \u03b2-galactosidase staining and alterations in cell morphology . Drug effects were also evaluated in a murine model of B16/F10 cells that localizes to the lungs while peripheral neuropathy was assessed by three complementary behavioral assays . RESULTS : Both HCT-116 colon cancer cells and B16/F10 melanoma cells were sensitive to JG-03-14 in that the drug demonstrated tumor cell killing . However , there was minimal induction of apoptosis . In contrast , there was clear evidence for autophagy and autophagic flux while the residual surviving cells appeared to be in a state of irreversible senescence . Inhibition of drug-induced autophagy in either the melanoma cells or the colon carcinoma cells was only slightly protective as the cells instead died by apoptosis . JG-03-14 reduced the size of tumor nodules in mice lungs ; furthermore , the drug did not promote peripheral neuropathy . CONCLUSIONS : Taken together with evidence for its actions as a vascular disrupting agent , these observations support the potential utility of JG-03-14 to effectively treat malignancies that might be resistant to conventional chemotherapy through evasion of apoptosis .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "id": "23178952"}

Here , we report that Bmi-1 , originally identified as a c-Myc cooperating oncoprotein , can bypass senescence , extend the replicative life span , and immortalize MECs . Furthermore , Bmi-1 was overexpressed in immortal MECs and several breast cancer cell lines . Overexpression of Bmi-1 in MECs led to activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) transcription and induction of telomerase activity . Telomerase induction by Bmi-1 was an early event in the extension of the replicative life span and immortalization . Bmi-1 was not overexpressed in hTERT-immortalized MECs , suggesting that Bmi-1 functions upstream of hTERT . Although , c-Myc has been reported to induce telomerase in MECs , Bmi-1 appeared to act independently of c-Myc binding sequences in the hTERT promoter . Deletion analysis of the Bmi-1 protein suggested that the RING finger , as well as a conserved helix-turn-helix-turn domain , were required for its ability to induce telomerase and immortalize MECs .

In this study , we evaluated the gene expression profiles of the colon cancer cell lines treated with SN-38 , the active metabolite of topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 3 colon cancer cell lines : KM12C , KM12SM and KM12l4a . The 3 cell lines were treated with SN-38 , and samples were obtained after 24 and 48 hour treatments . The gene expression analyses were performed using oligonucleotide microarrays comprising of approximately 27,000 spots where the untreated controls were compared to the SN-38-treated samples . RESULTS Unsupervised clustering clearly distinguished the treated cell lines from the untreated . Supervised analysis identified 3,974 significant genes ( p = 0.05 ) differentiating the treated samples from the untreated , majority of which were down-regulated after treatment . The top-ranked down-regulated genes in the treated cell lines included those related to receptor and kinase activity , signal transduction , apoptosis , RNA processing , protein metabolism and transport , cell cycle and transcription . A smaller number of genes were up-regulated in the cell lines after treatment and included genes involved in apoptosis , transcription , development and differentiation . CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that the expression of the genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as RNA , DNA and protein metabolism were affected by SN-38 .

{"sentence": "BACKGROUND Lung cancer often develops in association with chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases with an influx of neutrophils . More detailed information on inflammatory pathways and the role of neutrophils herein is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of inflammation associated cancer . METHODS In the present study , we used microarrays in order to obtain a global view of the transcriptional responses of the lung to LPS in mice , which mimics an acute lung inflammation . To investigate the influence of neutrophils in this process , we depleted mice from circulating neutrophils by treatment with anti-PMN antibodies prior to LPS exposure . RESULTS A total of 514 genes was greater than 1.5-fold differentially expressed in the LPS induced lung inflammation model. 394 of the 514 were up regulated genes mostly involved in cell cycle and immune/inflammation related processes , such as cytokine/chemokine activity and signalling . Down regulated genes represented nonimmune processes , such as development , metabolism and transport . Notably , the number of genes and pathways that were differentially expressed , was reduced when animals were depleted from circulating neutrophils , confirming the central role of neutrophils in the inflammatory response . Furthermore , there was a significant correlation between the differentially expressed gene list and the promutagenic DNA lesion M1dG , suggesting that it is the extent of the immune response which drives genetic instability in the inflamed lung . Several genes that were specifically regulated by the presence of activated neutrophils could be identified and these were mostly involved in interferon signalling , oxidative stress response and cell cycle progression . The latter possibly refers to a higher rate of cell turnover in the inflamed lung with neutrophils , suggesting that the neutrophil influx is associated with a higher risk for the accumulation and fixation of mutations .

The resulting 5-hmC-enriched DNA fragments could be used for downstream analyses , including next-generation sequencing . Our selective labeling and capture protocol confers high sensitivity , applicable to any source of genomic DNA with variable/diverse 5-hmC abundances .

{"sentence": "PURPOSE Germline mutations in BRCA1 result in a strong predisposition to breast cancer , with frequent loss of heterozygosity of the remaining wild-type allele . The development of BRCA1 tumors is likely to depend on additional genetic alterations and gene expression changes which follow growth and DNA repair defects associated with BRCA1 deficiency . The identification of these modifications offers an opportunity to find surrogate markers of BRCA1 tumors . Here , we sought to identify differentially expressed proteins related to BRCA1 depletion . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We used isogenic HeLa cells either stably knocked-down or not for BRCA1 ( BRCA1(KD) ) and compared protein profiles of these cells by DIGE . RESULTS We detected increased levels of Replication protein A2 ( RPA2 ) in BRCA1(KD) cells as compared to control cells . RPA2 is an essential protein required for DNA replication and repair . We further demonstrated that depletion of RPA2 subunit delays growth of BRCA1(KD) respect to isogenic control cells . Strikingly , elevated levels of RPA2 were more frequently observed in BRCA1 tumors when triple-negative tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers ( n=13 ) and non-carriers ( n=36 ) were stained in situ for RPA2 . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE RPA2 up-regulation may thus be involved in the growth and/or survival of BRCA1 tumor cells and useful in immunohistochemical discrimination of triple-negative BRCA1 tumors .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "21137066"}

Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) has a potent angiogenic activity and mutations of the p53 gene has been thought to upregulate VEGF . The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of these tumor biomarkers for angiogenesis relative to the information derived from established clinicopathological parameters in gastric cancer . METHODS In this study , we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of VEGF and p53 expression in 145 tissue samples obtained from gastric cancer patients undergoing curative surgical treatment . To evaluate angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) was counted by staining endothelial cells immunohistochemically using anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody . RESULTS High MVD was significantly associated with depth of tumor invasion and distant metastasis ( p = 0.004 , 0.021 , respectively ) . Moreover , overall survival for patients with high MVD were significantly lower than that of low MVD ( p = 0.048 ) . Positive expression of VEGF correlated significantly with lymph node and distant metastasis ( p = 0.040 , 0.048 , respectively ) . However , no significant correlation was found between p53 expression and various clinicopathological parameters . VEGF positive tumors showed a higher MVD than VEGF negative tumors ( p = 0.028 ) . The expression of p53 did not correlate with VEGF expression . Also , the relationship between the status of p53 expression and MVD had not statistically significant differences . In the multivariate analysis , status of VEGF , p53 expression and MVD were not an independent prognostic factor .

The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic effect of luteolin on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and the molecular mechanism . METHODS C57BL/6 mice were treated with cisplatin ( 20 mg/kg ) with or without treatment with luteolin ( 50 mg/kg for 3 days ) . Renal function , histological changes , degree of oxidative stress and tubular apoptosis were examined . The effects of luteolin on cisplatin-induced expression of renal p53 , PUMA-\u03b1 and Bcl-2 family proteins were evaluated .

The expression of inflammatory mediators , angiogenic growth factors , and angiogenic activities in the absence or presence of Korean red ginseng extracts ( KRGE ) were evaluated in HUVECs stimulated with the H2S generator sodium hydrogen sulfide ( NaHS ) . KRGE efficiently decreased the expression of cystathionine \u03b2-synthase and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase , enzymes that are essential for H2S synthesis . Concomitantly , a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators , including cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase , and several angiogenic factors , including interleukin ( IL)-8 , hypoxia inducible factor-1a , vascular endothelial growth factor , IL-6 , and matrix metalloproteinases , was observed ; all of these factors are normally induced after NaHS . An in vitro angiogenesis assay demonstrated that NaHS significantly increased tube formation in endothelial cells , whereas KRGE pretreatment significantly attenuated tube formation .

METHODS : To test the converse hypothesis that inhibition of endogenous IGFBP-6 secretion stimulates Caco-2 cell proliferation , cells were transfected with the antisense IGFBP-6 expression construct or pcDNA3 vector only , and single colonies resistant to G418 sulfate were isolated . RESULTS : Our initial studies indicated that three antisense clones grew faster and produced less IGFBP-6 than two pcDNA3 clones , so antisense IGFBP-6 #5 and pcDNA3 #8 were selected for further detailed analysis . Both the control and antisense clones grew in serum-free medium reaching a plateau density at day eight . However , the antisense clone grew at a rate faster than that of the control and reached a final density that was 31 +/- 3% higher than the control . Northern blot , ligand blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that accumulation of IGFBP-6 mRNA and concentrations of IGFBP-6 peptide produced by the antisense clone were decreased by 80-90% compared to the control . The doubling times of the antisense and control clones were 21.9 +/- 0.4 and 24.8 +/- 0.3 h ( P < 0.05 ) , respectively . Exogenous IGF-I and IGF-II ( 0.2-200 nmol/L ) stimulated proliferation of both the control and antisense clones in a dose-dependent manner , but the relative potency and efficacy of IGF-II was higher in the antisense clone compared to the control . These results indicate that suppression of IGFBP-6 secretion correlates with an increase in the basal rate of Caco-2 cell growth .

Nevertheless , a subset of TGCTs are either innately resistant or acquire resistance to cisplatin during treatment . Understanding the mechanisms underlying TGCT sensitivity/resistance to cisplatin as well as the identification of novel strategies to target cisplatin-resistant TGCTs have major clinical implications . Herein , we have examined the proficiency of five embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cell lines to repair cisplatin-induced ICLs . Using \\u03b3H2AX staining as a marker of double strand break formation , we found that EC cell lines were either incapable of or had a reduced ability to repair ICL-induced damage . The defect correlated with reduced Homologous Recombination ( HR ) repair , as demonstrated by the reduction of RAD51 foci formation and by direct evaluation of HR efficiency using a GFP-reporter substrate . HR-defective tumors cells are known to be sensitive to the treatment with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor . In line with this observation , we found that EC cell lines were also sensitive to PARP inhibitor monotherapy . The magnitude of sensitivity correlated with HR-repair reduced proficiency and with the expression levels and activity of PARP1 protein . In addition , we found that PARP inhibition strongly enhanced the response of the most resistant EC cells to cisplatin , by reducing their ability to overcome the damage . These results point to a reduced proficiency of HR repair as a source of sensitivity of ECs to ICL-inducing agents and PARP inhibitor monotherapy , and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PARP can be exploited to target the stem cell component of the TGCTs ( namely ECs ) and to enhance the sensitivity of cisplatin-resistant TGCTs to standard treatments .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "23251575"}

These functions require the ASPP2 N terminus because BBP ( also known as 53BP2S ) , an alternatively spliced ASPP2 isoform lacking the N terminus , was defective in binding Ras-GTP and stimulating Raf/MEK/ERK signaling . Decreased ASPP2 levels attenuated H-RasV12-induced senescence in normal human fibroblasts and neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes . Together , our results reveal a mechanism for ASPP2 tumor suppressor function via direct interaction with Ras-GTP to stimulate Ras-induced senescence in nontransformed human cells .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "23248303"}
{"sentence": "Rho GTPases are signaling molecules known to control cell motility . Several recent studies have suggested a role for Rho proteins in mediating tumor metastasis independent of their affects on cell proliferation . As Rho proteins require post-translational modification with a geranlygeranyl moiety for full activity , we tested the affect of blocking geranylation on localization , downstream signaling , and stimulation of invasion . Expression of a constitutively active Rho construct in A375 melanoma cells dramatically stimulated invasion through Matrigel membranes ; however , a constitutively active RhoA mutated so that it cannot be geranylated , failed to stimulate invasion . Moreover , expression of epitope or GFP tagged modifications of this nongeranylatable constitutively active Rho demonstrated that geranylation is necessary for correct cellular localization of Rho . Geranylation was also found to be necessary for full downstream activation of serum response factor mediated transcription . Pharmacologic inhibition of Rho geranylation produced similar inhibition of Rho localization , signaling , and invasion . Our results suggest that inhibition of Rho geranylation may be an attractive pharmacologic target for inhibiting melanoma metastasis .", "label": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "12445208"}

In this study , we demonstrated that oral administration of MD-Fraction as well as i.p. injection significantly inhibited tumor growth in murine tumor models . After oral administration , MD-Fraction was not transferred to the blood in its free form but was captured by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells ( DCs ) present in the Peyer's patch . The captured MD-Fraction was then transported to the spleen , thereby inducing the systemic immune response . Our study showed that MD-Fraction directly induced DC maturation via a C-type lectin receptor dectin-1 pathway . The therapeutic response of orally administered MD-Fraction was associated with ( i ) induced systemic tumor-antigen specific T cell response via dectin-1-dependent activation of DCs , ( ii ) increased infiltration of the activated T cells into the tumor , and ( iii ) decreased number of tumor-caused immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells .

At the time of discovery of metastatic disease , the patients , six women and five men , ranged in age from 20 to 83 years . Primary sites of involvement included the parotid gland ( eight cases ) , submandibular gland ( two cases ) , and the nasal septum ( one case ) . With one exception , all the patients had at least a single recurrences of their primary mixed tumor , but two or more recurrences were the norm before development of metastatic foci . The metastases were discovered from six to 52 years following the occurrence of the primary tumor . Metastatic deposits were identified in bone , lung , regional lymph nodes , skin , kidney , retroperitoneum , oral cavity , pharynx , calvarium , and central nervous system . The metastases either occurred simultaneously with an episode of recurrent mixed tumor ( n = 5 ) or from 5 to 29 years after a recurrence ( n = 6 ) . The treatment of the primary , recurrent , and metastatic neoplasms was surgical excision .

Antidepressant desipramine ( DMI ) is clinically prescribed in the auxiliary treatment of cancer patients . Increasing evidences suggest that DMI has a broad spectrum of target-off biological effects , such as anticancer properties . Our previous study revealed that DMI at the clinical relevant concentrations could induce CHOP-dependent apoptotic death in C6 glioma cells . In this study , we further explored the pro-autophagic effect of DMI in C6 glioma cells and its underlying mechanism . Treatment with DMI could induce autophagic cell death characterized by the formation of autophagosome and the elevated level of autophagic protein Beclin-1 and cellular redistribution of marker LC3 . Meanwhile , DMI inhibited the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway which is considered as a negative regulator of autophagy . Furthermore , DMI activated PERK-eIF2\u03b1 and ATF6 of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress pathway , while knockdown of PERK with the PERK-specific short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) could obviously attenuate the autophagy . The results strongly suggested that DMI could induce autophagy through the PERK-ER stress pathway in C6 glioma cells .

{"sentence": "BACKGROUND & AIMS Hepatocytes are considered an exception of the paradigmatic inverse correlation between cell proliferation and terminal differentiation . In fact , hepatic vital functions are guaranteed by proliferating parenchymal cells during liver regeneration . However , a fine molecular characterization of the relationship between proliferation and differentiation in hepatocytes has been hampered by the lack of reliable in vivo or in vitro models . METHODS The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program was characterized in the immortalized , untransformed and differentiated hepatocytic cell line MMH , using several techniques . Particularly , two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis combined to tandem mass spectrometry proteomic approach was used . Cell cycle and cell adhesion properties of MMH have been altered using either myc-overexpression and MEK1/2 inhibition or a constitutive active beta-catenin mutant , respectively . RESULTS The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program is stimulated by the exit from the cell cycle induced by cell-cell contact . Comparative proteomic analysis of proliferating versus quiescent hepatocytes validated the importance of contact inhibition , identifying 68 differently expressed gene products , representing 49 unique proteins . Notably , enzymes involved in important liver functions such as detoxification processes , lipid metabolism , iron and vitamin A storage and secretion , anti-inflammatory response and exocytosis were found significantly up-regulated in quiescent hepatocytes . Finally , we found that : ( i ) cell cycle arrest induced by MEK1/2 inhibition is not sufficient to induce hepatic product expression ; ( ii ) constitutive activation of beta-catenin counteracts the contact inhibition-induced terminal differentiation . CONCLUSION The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program requires a quiescent state maintained by cell-cell contact through the E-cadherin/beta-catenin pathway , rather than the inhibition of proliferation .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "20031246"}
{"sentence": "PURPOSE Steroid hormones and growth factors affect lung cancer , and it is possible they act in concert to influence patient outcome . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Primary lung tumors and normal lung tissue were analyzed for expression and localization of estrogen receptor \u03b1 and \u03b2-1 ( ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 ) , aromatase , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . RESULTS Tumors expressed higher levels of ER\u03b2 compared to matched normal lung , whereas the reverse was true of PR . High cytoplasmic ER\u03b2 expression was identified as an independent negative prognostic predictor of overall survival ( OS ; HR = 1.67 ) , and low total PR was identified as an independent negative predictor of time to progression ( TTP ; HR = 1.59 ) . After adjusting for stage , age , sex , and smoking , combined high cytoplasmic ER\u03b2 and low total PR showed enhanced effects on OS ( HR = 2.64 ) and on TTP ( HR = 6.02 ) . Further effects on OS were observed when EGFR expression was included ( HR = 5.32 ) . Patients with low cytoplasmic ER\u03b2 , low aromatase , low EGFR , and high total PR had shorter OS than patients with the opposite pattern ( HR = 6.60 ) . Contribution of these markers to survival showed no significant sex differences in a multivariable model . ER\u03b1 was elevated in tumors but was not predictive of survival , and appears to represent a variant ER\u03b1 protein that is only recognized by a C-terminal antibody . CONCLUSIONS Hormonal and EGFR pathways together may contribute to lung cancer prognosis . Lung tumors with high ER\u03b2-1/low PR may define patients with aggressive biology .

The attitude of sub-G1 peak in DNA histogram was determined by FCM . The TUNEL positive cell percentage was identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT)-mediated Biotin dUNP end labeling technique . It was found that when HL-60 cells were treated with 25 mumol/L curcumin for 24 h , the expression level of Mcl-1 was down-regulated , but that of Bax and Bak up-regulated time-dependently . There was significant difference in the expression level of Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak between the curcumin-treated groups and control group ( P < 0.05-0.01 ) . At the same time , curcumin had no effect on progress of cell cycle in primaty acute myelogenous leukemia at newly diagnosis , but could increase the peak of Sub-G1 ( P < 0.05 ) , and down-regulate the expression of Mcl-1 and up-regulate the expression of Bax and Bak with the difference being statistically significant .
