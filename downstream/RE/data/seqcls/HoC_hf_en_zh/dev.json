{"sentence": "BACKGROUND & AIMS GUCY2C is the intestinal receptor for the paracrine hormones guanylin and uroguanylin that converts guanosine-5'-triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) . It functions as a tumor suppressor ; its loss disrupts intestinal homeostasis and promotes tumorigenesis . We investigated the effects of GUCY2C loss on intestinal cell proliferation , metabolism , signaling , and tumorigenesis in mice . METHODS Intestinal cell proliferation and metabolism were examined in Gucy2c(-/-) and colon cancer cells by microscopy , immunoblot , and functional analyses . Microarray analyses compared gene expression profiles of intestine cell from Gucy2c(-/-) and wild-type mice. v akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog ( AKT ) regulation and signaling were examined , and the role of AKT in GUCY2C-dependent tumorigenesis was defined in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice . RESULTS The size and number of intestinal crypts increased in Gucy2c(-/-) mice ; the associated epithelial cells showed accelerated proliferation , increased glycolysis , and reduced oxidative phosphorylation , which was reversed by oral administration of cGMP . Conversely , activating guanylyl cyclase C in human colon cancer cells delayed cell-cycle progression , decreased DNA synthesis and colony formation , reduced glycolysis , and increased mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production . AKT signaling pathways were activated in intestines of Gucy2c(-/-) mice , associated with increased AKT phosphorylation . Disruption of AKT activity , pharmacologically or genetically , reduced DNA synthesis , proliferation , and glycolysis , and increased mitochondrial biogenesis . Intestinal tumorigenesis increased after administration of azoxymethane to Gucy2c(-/-) mice , compared with wild-type mice , but was eliminated in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice .

Amifostine was again administered immediately following surgical removal of the tumor-bearing limbs by amputation , and then once more 2 days later . Nontumor-bearing control animals were treated using the same dosing and surgery schedules . The average number of pulmonary metastases per animal was determined for each experimental group . A significant reduction ( P <.05 ) in the average number of pulmonary metastases was observed only in the group of animals exposed to a dose per fraction of 50 mg/kg . A dose of 100 mg/kg was less effective while 200 mg/kg had no effect on metastases formation in this study . The effects of amifostine exposure on serum levels of the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin were also determined using Western analysis . Correlating with the antimetastatic effect measured , exposure of animals to 50 mg/kg of amifostine resulted in a four-fold enhanced serum level of angiostatin above control levels . This phenomenon occurred in both tumor-bearing as well as nontumor-bearing animals . In contrast , a dose of 200-mg/kg amifostine administered intraperitoneally under these conditions had no measurable effect on angiostatin serum levels in this animal system . The enhanced ability of relatively low doses of amifostine to inhibit spontaneous metastases formation suggests that effective antimetastatic therapies with amifostine can be designed with minimal toxic side effects .

{"sentence": "Many different cellular pathways have evolved to protect the genome from the deleterious effects of DNA damage that result from exposure to chemical and physical agents . Among these is a process called transcription-coupled repair ( TCR ) that catalyzes the removal of DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of expressed genes , often resulting in a preferential bias of damage clearance from this strand relative to its non-transcribed counterpart . Lesions subject to this type of repair include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that are normally repaired by nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and thymine glycols ( TGs ) that are removed primarily by base excision repair ( BER ) . While the mechanism underlying TCR is not completely clear , it is known that its facilitation requires proteins used by other repair pathways like NER . It is also believed that the signal for TCR is the stalled RNA polymerase that results when DNA damage prevents its translocation during transcription elongation . While there is a clear role for some NER proteins in TCR , the involvement of BER proteins is less clear . To explore this further , we studied the removal of 7-methylguanine ( 7MeG ) and 3-methyladenine ( 3MeA ) from the dihydrofolate reductase ( dhfr ) gene of murine cell lines that vary in their repair phenotypes. 7MeG and 3MeA constitute the two principal N-methylpurines formed in DNA following exposure to methylating agents . In mammalian cells , alkyladenine DNA alkyladenine glycosylase ( Aag ) is the major enzyme required for the repair of these lesions via BER , and their removal from the total genome is quite rapid . There is no observable TCR of these lesions in specific genes in DNA repair proficient cells ; however , it is possible that the rapid repair of these adducts by BER masks any TCR . The repair of 3MeA and 7MeG was examined in cells lacking Aag , NER , or both Aag and NER to determine if rapid overall repair masks TCR . The results show that both 3MeA and 7MeG are removed without strand bias from the dhfr gene of BER deficient ( Aag deficient ) and NER deficient murine cell lines . Furthermore , repair of 3MeA in this region is highly dependent on Aag , but repair of 7MeG is equally efficient in the repair proficient , BER deficient , and NER deficient cell lines . Strikingly , in the absence of both BER and NER , neither 7MeG nor 3MeA is repaired . These results demonstrate that NER , but not TCR , contributes to the repair of 7MeG , and to a lesser extent 3MeA .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "12509290"}

Here we report that short hairpin RNA-mediated gene suppression of wild-type p53 or ectopic expression of mutant temperature-sensitive dominant-negative p53(V135A) increased glucose consumption and lactate production , decreased oxygen consumption and enhanced hypoxia-induced cell death in p53 wild-type human glioblastoma cells .

An SCO2 transgene reverted the metabolic phenotype and restored resistance towards hypoxia in p53-depleted and p53 mutant glioma cells in a rotenone-sensitive manner , demonstrating that this effect was dependent on intact oxidative phosphorylation .

RH maps have been proposed to provide i ) higher and ii ) more uniform resolution than genetic maps , and iii ) to be independent of the distribution patterns observed for meiotic recombination . An in vivo RH panel was generated for mapping chromosome 3B of wheat in an attempt to provide a complete scaffold for this Gb segment of the genome and compare the resolution to previous genetic maps . RESULTS A high density RH map with 541 marker loci anchored to chromosome 3B spanning a total distance of 1871.9 cR was generated . Detailed comparisons with a genetic map of similar quality confirmed that i ) the overall resolution of the RH map was 10.5 fold higher and ii ) six fold more uniform . A significant interaction ( r = 0.879 at p = 0.01 ) was observed between the DNA repair mechanism and the distribution of crossing-over events .

METHODS Isolated leiomyoma cells were subcultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 5 days and stepped down to serum-free conditions for an additional 6 days in the presence or absence of graded concentrations of GnRHa ( 10(-9) mol/l to 10(-12) mol/l ) . The effects of GnRHa on the number of viable cells , expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , Fas and Fas ligand , and apoptosis in cultured leiomyoma cells were examined by MTT ( 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide ) assay , immunocytochemical analysis , Western blot analysis and TUNEL assay respectively . RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of GnRH receptor mRNA in cultured leiomyoma cells . RESULTS Treatment with GnRHa resulted in a decrease in the number of cultured viable leiomyoma cells assessed by MTT assay in a dose-dependent manner compared with that in control cultures ( P<0.01 ) . The growth inhibition of cultured leiomyoma cells treated with GnRHa in concentrations higher than 10(-10) mol/l was associated with the suppression of the proliferative potential characterized by a decrease in PCNA-positive rate of the cultured cells ( P<0.01 ) and an increase in the apoptosis-positive rate assessed by TUNEL assay ( P<0.05 and P<0.01 ) . GnRHa markedly increased the expression of Fas and induced the expression of Fas ligand in the cultured leiomyoma cells on the basis of Western blot analysis . These direct effects of GnRHa on the number of viable cultured leiomyoma cells , PCNA-positive rate , apoptosis-positive rate and Fas/Fas ligand expression in the cultured leiomyoma cells were only attained after the 4-day treatment . RT-PCR analysis revealed that GnRH receptor mRNA was expressed in cultured leiomyoma cells . CONCLUSIONS The present results demonstrate that GnRHa directly inhibits the growth of human uterine leiomyoma cells by suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis , which might be associated with the increase in Fas expression and the induction of Fas ligand expression in the cells .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "id": "11888853"}

However , the observation that RB is hyperphosphorylated in the presence of BGLF4 raised the possibility that BGLF4 may have a Cdk2-like activity to promote S-phase progression . Here , we investigated the regulatory effects of BGLF4 on cell cycle progression and found that S-phase progression and DNA synthesis were interrupted by BGLF4 in mammalian cells .

The expression of the Notch ligand Delta-like ( Dll)-4 in the MSC(miR-126) group was also increased . For in vivo experiments , MSC(miR-126) cultures were intramyocardially injected into the infarct region of the hearts of female C57BL/6 mice ( an acute myocardial infarction model ) who had undergone ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery . The survival of MSC(miR-126) cultures , determined by Sry expression , was increased at 7 days after transplantation . MSC(miR-126)-treated animals showed significantly improved cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography 2 weeks later . The expression levels of angiogenic factors and Dll-4 in the infarcted myocardium were further increased by MSC(miR-126) compared with MSCs or MSC(null) cultures .

Radiation response was measured in terms of cell survival , recovery of sublethal ( SLD ) and potentially lethal damage ( PLD ) , induction of and recovery of DNA strand breaks , and fidelity of DNA repair using a cell-free plasmid assay .

In order to characterize the role of GSH in the joining of DNA DSBs , we induced DNA lesions with bleomycin ( Blem ) in conjunction with either high- or low-LET radiation ( X-rays ) since the chemistry of the free DNA ends created by Blem and X-rays is similar . CHO cells were exposed to reduced GSH at a concentration of 2mM for 3h before radiation . Treatment with Blem ( 20mug/ml ) was carried out for 2h before the cells were exposed to radiation . Our results show that the frequency of chromosomal aberration increases with increased LET . Heavy ion exposed cells show a higher frequency of CA over time than do X-irradiated cells . An analysis of the first post-irradiation mitosis of exposed CHO cells shows that high-LET radiation induces more breaks than exchange-type aberrations and exogenous GSH has no influence on high-LET radiation-induced DNA damage . The DNA lesions induced by low-LET radiation interact relatively strongly with Blem-induced lesions whereas interaction between Blem and high-LET radiations was poor .

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the WWOX tumor suppressor gene in Wilms ' tumor samples . We evaluated the correlation between expression of WWOX and genes involved in proliferation ( Ki67 ) , apoptosis ( BCL2 , BAX ) , signal transduction ( ERBB4 , ERBB2 , EGFR ) , cell cycle ( CCNE1 , CCND1 ) , cell adhesion ( CDH1 ) and transcription ( TP73 ) using real-time RT-PCR in 23 tumor samples . We also analyzed the potential causes of WWOX gene expression reduction i.e. , promoter methylation status ( MethylScreen method ) and loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) status .

Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment is associated with peritoneal tumor dissemination and massive ascites , which contribute to high mortality in ovarian cancer . Tumor suppressor p53 is frequently deleted or mutated in aggressive and high-grade ovarian cancer , probably aggravating cancer progression and increasing mortality . We therefore investigated the influence of p53 on proinflammatory chemokines in ovarian cancer cells . A PCR array of the chemokine network revealed that ovarian cancer cells with low or mutated p53 expression expressed high levels of proinflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1 , 2 , 3 and 8 . Transient transfection of p53 into p53-null ovarian cancer cells downregulated proinflammatory chemokines induced by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 ( TNF ) , a proinflammatory cytokine abundantly expressed in ovarian cancer . Furthermore , p53 restoration or stabilization blocked TNF-induced NF-\u03baB promoter activity and reduced TNF-activated I\u03baB . Restoration of p53 increased ubiquitination of I\u03baB , resulting from concurrently reduced proteasome activity followed by stability of I\u03baB . A ubiquitination PCR array on restoration of p53 did not reveal any significant change in expression except for Mdm2 , indicating that the balance between p53 and Mdm2 is more important in regulating NF-\u03baB signaling rather than the direct effect of p53 on ubiquitin-related genes or I\u03baB kinases . In addition , nutlin-3 , a specific inducer of p53 stabilization , inhibited proinflammatory chemokines by reducing TNF-activated I\u03baB through p53 stabilization .

In addition , the expression of either isoform complements the chromosome condensation defect found in genetically MCPH1-deficient or MCPH1 siRNA-depleted cells , demonstrating a redundancy of both MCPH1 isoforms for the regulation of chromosome condensation . Strikingly however , both transcripts are regulated antagonistically during cell-cycle progression and there are functional differences between the isoforms with regard to the DNA damage response ; MCPH1-FL localizes to phosphorylated H2AX repair foci following ionizing irradiation , while MCPH1\\u0394e9-14 was evenly distributed in the nucleus .

We attempted to evaluate the markers of oxidative stress , antioxidant mechanism and the inflammatory pathway in patients with breast cancer . METHODS This study was carried out in departments of Biochemistry and Surgery , Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Hospitals , New Delhi , India . A total of 60 cases of carcinoma of the breast and 60 healthy controls were included in the study . The parameters that were assayed include markers of oxidative stress-conjugated dienes , thiobarbitone reactive substances ( TBARS ) , antioxidants-superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , glutathione ( GSH ) and markers of inflammation-interleukin-6(IL-6) and ferritin . RESULTS There was a significant decline in the antioxidant levels and a significant rise in oxidant levels in patients with carcinoma of the breast , compared to controls . The inflammatory markers-IL-6 and ferritin-were also significantly higher in patients with breast cancer . A significantly positive correlation was observed between the IL-6 levels and conjugated dienes with the stage of breast carcinoma ; whilst a significantly negative correlation was observed between the levels of conjugated dienes and superoxide dismutase and superoxide dismutase levels with the disease staging .

{"sentence": "Past studies have shown that amplified insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1)/IGF1 receptor ( IGF1-R ) signalling has an important role in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) development , progression and resistance to treatment . In this report , we demonstrate that downregulation of microRNA-497 ( miR-497 ) as a result of DNA copy number reduction is involved in upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells . MiR-497 and miR-195 of the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family that share the same 3 ' untranslated region ( 3'UTR ) binding seed sequence and are predicted to target IGF1-R were concurrently downregulated in the majority of CRC tissues relative to paired adjacent normal mucosa . However , only overexpression of miR-497 led to suppression of the IGF1-R 3'UTR activity and downregulation of the endogenous IGF1-R protein in CRC cells . This was associated with inhibition of cell survival , proliferation and invasion , and increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by various stimuli including the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil , and the death ligand tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand . The biological effect of miR-497 on CRC cells was largely mediated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalling , as overexpression of an active form of Akt reversed its impact on cell survival and proliferation , recapitulating the effect of overexpression of IGF1-R . Downregulation of miR-497 and miR-195 appeared to associate with copy number loss of a segment of chromosome 17p13.1 , where these miRs are located at proximity . Similarly to miR-195 , the members of the same miR family , miR-424 that was upregulated , and miR-15a , miR-15b and miR-16 that were unaltered in expression in CRC tissues compared with paired adjacent normal mucosa , did not appear to have a role in regulating the expression of IGF1-R . Taken together , these results identify downregulation of miR-497 as an important mechanism of upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells that contributes to malignancy of CRC.Oncogene advance online publication , 18 June 2012 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.214 .", "label": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "id": "22710713"}

C. albicans infection involves endogenous production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) . Increased levels of these cytokines have already been correlated with metastasis of most common cancer types . In this study , a well-established model of IL-18-dependent hepatic melanoma metastasis was used to study whether C. albicans can alter the ability of murine B16 melanoma ( B16M ) cells to colonize the liver . First , we determined the ability of intrasplenically ( IS ) injected B16M cells to metastasize into the liver of mice challenged with 5 x 10(4) C. albicans cells by three different routes ( intravenous , IV ; intrasplenic , IS ; or intraperitoneal , IP ) 12 h prior to injection of B16M cells . We demonstrated that C. albicans significantly increased metastasis of B16M cells with all three fungal injection routes . Pro-metastatic effects occurred when hepatic colonization with B16M cells place after the peak of TNF-alpha and IL-18 levels had been reached in the hepatic blood of fungal challenged mice . In a second set of experiments , mice were fungal challenged 4 days after injection of B16M cells . In these mice , C. albicans also potentiated the growth of established micro-metastases . Significantly , the fungal challenge had pro-metastatic effects without the C. albicans being able to reach the liver , suggesting that soluble factors can promote metastasis in remote sites .

{"sentence": "BACKGROUND Although chemotherapy offers promise of increased survival for children with medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme , drug resistance occurs frequently , resulting in tumor progression and death . Resistance to nitrosoureas and methylating agents , which damage DNA , can be mediated by a DNA repair protein , O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase ( AGAT ) . Depletion of this protein with alkylguanines or methylating agents , however , restores tumor cell sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of chloroethylnitrosoureas ( e.g. , carmustine [ BCNU] ) . PURPOSE This study was designed to determine whether resistance to the activity of nitrosourea ( the drug BCNU ) in BCNU-resistant human medulloblastoma ( D341 Med ) and human glioblastoma multiforme ( D-456 MG ) can be reversed by the methylating agent streptozocin and the O6-substituted guanines O6-methylguanine and O6-benzylguanine . METHODS Xenografts were grown subcutaneously in athymic BALB/c mice . BCNU was administered as a single intraperitoneal injection at doses of 100 mg/m2 , 75 mg/m2 , or 38 mg/m2--i.e. , 1.0 , 0.75 , or 0.38 , respectively , of the dose lethal to 10% of treated animals ( LD10 ) . Mice were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of O6-benzylguanine or O6-methylguanine ( 240 mg/m2 ) or with streptozocin ( 600 mg/m2 ) daily for 4 days . Response was assessed by tumor growth delay and tumor regression . AGAT activity in the xenografts was measured at 1 and 6 hours after pretreatment , at the time tumors were excised . RESULTS Pretreatment with O6-benzylguanine , O6-methylguanine , or streptozocin reduced AGAT activity to 4% , 25% , and 95% of control values , respectively , in D341 Med and 0% , 0% , and 25% of control values , respectively , in D-456 MG 1 hour after injection . After 6 hours , levels changed to 7% , 61% , and 116% of control values in D341 Med and 0% , 79% , and 21% of control values in D-456 MG , respectively . Both D341 Med and D-456 MG xenografts were completely resistant to BCNU at its LD10 . Pretreatment with O6-benzylguanine increased BCNU sensitivity in both types of xenograft . In contrast , treatment with BCNU plus O6-methylguanine or streptozocin did not produce growth delays substantially different from those produced by BCNU alone , reflecting the more efficient depletion of AGAT by O6-benzylguanine . Following therapy with BCNU plus O6-benzylguanine at 0.38 LD10 , tumor regressions were seen in eight of 10 D341 Med and in all 10 D-456 MG xenografts . CONCLUSION We recommend comprehensive clinical toxicologic evaluation of combination therapy with O6-benzylguanine plus BCNU , which would allow subsequent design of phase I clinical trials .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "1334154"}

The apoptotic index was measured by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. hTERT subcellular localization and protein expression were determined by Western blotting and multiple immunofluorescence labling combined with laser confocal scanning microscopy . Results The proliferation of EC 9706 cells was significantly inhibited by bufalin along with the increase of processing time and concentrations ( p<0.01 ) . After the EC9706 cells were exposed to 100 nmol/L bufalin,the number of cells gradually decreased in G(1) phase and increased in S and G(2)/M phases(p<0.05) .

In contrast , aFGF or bFGF enhancement of C3 cell thymidine incorporation was about 5% of that of T5 cells , and effects were principally mitogen concentration independent . Saturation analyses and cross-linking studies established that both C3 and T5 cells contained high-affinity FGF receptors of 120 and 145 kilodaltons and that receptor content and Kd of C3 and T5 cells were comparable. aFGF or bFGF stimulation of T5 cell thymidine incorporation profoundly decreased as cell plating density was reduced from 1.5 x 10(5) to 1.0 x 10(4) cells/well . The modest response of C3 cells to either aFGF or bFGF also decreased as cell plating density was reduced . Because heparin preserves FGF biological activity and enhances bFGF binding to high-affinity FGF receptors , we examined the effect of heparin on FGF stimulation of C3 cell thymidine incorporation . We found that changes in cell plating density and/or medium heparin concentration had variable , inconsistent effects . These were C3 cell plating density associated and included inhibition or modest enhancement of FGF effects . Binding analyses established that high-affinity bFGF binding of C3 and T5 cells immediately prior to assessing FGF-stimulated thymidine incorporation was comparable and independent of cell plating density , implying that C3 cell FGF insensitivity was not attributable to differences in C3 and T5 cell FGF receptor content at the time of mitogen stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "id": "1445801"}

{"sentence": "BACKGROUND The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is aberrantly activated in many solid tumors . In a prior study we showed that prostate cancer PC-3 cells exhibit constitutively activated c-Met without exogenous hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) ; however whether this characteristic is due to an endogenous HGF/c-Met autocrine loop remains controversial . In the current study we examined the response of PC-3 cells to an anti-HGF neutralizing antibody or a small molecule Met kinase inhibitor ( BMS-777607 ) . METHODS Cell scattering was tested by monitoring cell morphology after HGF stimulation . Cell migration was examined by both \" wound-healing \" and transwell assasy and invasion was detected by Matrigel-coated transwell assay . Proliferation , survival and anoikis were determined by MTT , colony formation and trypan blue exclusion assay , respectively . Gene and protein expression were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blot , respectively . RESULTS Although HGF mRNA could be detected in PC-3 cells , the molecular weight of secreted \" HGF \" protein was inconsistent with the functional recombinant HGF . Furthermore , conditioned medium from PC-3 cell cultures was ineffective at triggering either motogenic behavior or c-Met signaling in DU145 , another prostate cancer cell line expressing c-Met but lacking basal c-Met activation . PC-3 cells also were not responsive to the anti-HGF neutralizing antibody in experiments assessing proliferation , migration , or c-Met signaling . BMS-777607 treatment with micromolar doses nonetheless led to significant inhibition of multiple PC-3 cell functions including proliferation , clonogenicity , migration and invasion . At the molecular level , BMS-777607 suppressed autophosphorylated c-Met and downstream c-Src and Akt pathways . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the constitutive c-Met activation in PC-3 is independent of autocrine stimulation . Because PC-3 cells were responsive to BMS-777607 but not the anti-HGF antibody , the findings also indicate that under circumstances where c-Met is constitutively hyperactive in the absence of functional HGF , targeting the c-Met receptor remains a viable therapeutic option to impede cancer progression .", "label": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "id": "22639908"}

This result was confirmed in a coculture model of human monocytes with multicellular tumor spheroids . Blocking synthesis of tumor-derived lactate by oxamic acid , an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase , reversed the suppression of TNF secretion in this coculture model . We then investigated possible mechanisms underlying the suppression . Uptake of [ 3-(13)C]lactate by monocytes was shown by hyphenated mass spectrometry .

METHODS Core needle biopsy specimens were obtained from sixty cases of primary breast cancer before and 18-24 hours after the first cycle of neoadjuvant epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide ( EC ) treatment . Nuclear focus formation of DNA damage repair proteins was immunohistochemically analyzed and compared with tumor response to chemotherapy . RESULTS EC treatment induced nuclear foci of gammaH2AX , conjugated ubiquitin , and Rad51 in a substantial amount of cases . In contrast , BRCA1 foci were observed before treatment in the majority of the cases and only decreased after EC in thirteen cases . The presence of BRCA1- , gammaH2AX- , or Rad51-foci before treatment or the presence of Rad51-foci after treatment was inversely correlated with tumor response to chemotherapy . DNA damage response ( DDR ) competence was further evaluated by considering all four repair indicators together . A high DDR score significantly correlated with low tumor response to EC and EC + docetaxel whereas other clinicopathological factors analyzed did not . CONCLUSIONS High performing DDR focus formation resulted in tumor resistance to DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy . Our results suggested an importance of evaluation of DDR competence to predict breast cancer chemosensitivity , and merits further studying into its usefulness in exclusion of non-responder patients .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "id": "20205718"}

K-RAS signals via downstream effector pathways such as the MAPK and the PI3K signaling pathways , and much effort has been focused on developing drugs targeting components of these pathways . To better understand the requirements for K-RAS and its downstream signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K in pancreatic tumor maintenance , we established an inducible K-RAS knock down system that allowed us to ablate K-RAS in established tumors . Knock down of K-RAS resulted in impaired tumor growth in all pancreatic xenograft models tested , demonstrating that K-RAS expression is indeed required for tumor maintenance of K-RAS mutant pancreatic tumors . We further examined signaling downstream of K-RAS , and detected a robust reduction of pERK levels upon K-RAS knock down . In contrast , no effect on pAKT levels could be observed due to almost undetectable basal expression levels . To investigate the requirement of the MAPK and the PI3K pathways on tumor maintenance , three selected pancreatic xenograft models were tested for their response to MEK or PI3K inhibition . Tumors of all three models regressed upon MEK inhibition , but showed less pronounced response to PI3K inhibition . The effect of MEK inhibition on pancreatic xenografts could be enhanced further by combined application of a PI3K inhibitor .

Clinical trials investigating the therapeutic value of anti-IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R ) therapies in cancer , including prostate cancer , are ongoing . However , the multiple functions of the IGF network in the prostate are not entirely known . To elucidate the effects of IGF and insulin ( INS ) on prostate cells , we stimulated prostate cancer ( PC3 , DU145 , LNCaP , DUCaP ) and noncancerous prostate cells ( EP156T , RWPE-1 ) and observed differing responses : whereas cancer cells responded to IGF and INS exposure by way of enhanced cell proliferation and glucose consumption , basal to luminal differentiation was induced in noncancerous cells . The same diverse responses were observed when the growth factor receptors IGF1R or INSR were overexpressed . Down-regulation of IGF1R or INSR isoform A ( INSRA ) also inhibited only proliferation of cancer cells . The proliferative response induced by the INSR in cancer cells was mediated solely by the INSRA . Moreover we observed that the receptors of the IGF network mutually influence their expression and exert redundant functions , thus underscoring the functional molecular network formed by IGF , INS , IGF1R , and INSR . Collectively we found that both IGF1R and INSRA have oncogenic effects in prostate cancer , but the IGF network also has important physiological functions in the noncancerous prostate .

A total of 474 subjects who were free of liver cancer and cirrhosis and were initially selected as controls for previous case-control studies of aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Taiwan , were employed in this study . Aflatoxin-albumin adducts were determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C virus by enzyme immunoassay , as well as genotypes of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 and T1-1 by polymerase chain reaction . The detection rate of AFB1-albumin adducts was significantly higher in males ( 42.5% ) than in females ( 21.6% ) ( multivariate-adjusted odds ratio=2.6 , 95% confidence interval=1.4-5.0 ) . The formation of detectable albumin adducts was moderately higher in hepatitis B surface antigen carriers ( 42.8% ) than in non-carriers ( 36.6% ) ( multivariate-adjusted odds ratio=1.4 , 95% confidence interval=1.0-2.1 ) . In addition , the detection rate of AFB1-albumin adducts tended to increase with the increasing number of null genotypes of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 and glutathione S-transferase T1-1 . In conclusion , this cross-sectional study has assessed the relative contributions of environmental exposure and host susceptibility factors in the formation of AFB1-albumin adducts in a well characterised Chinese adult population .

In contrast , we show here that primary human fibroblasts continue to exhibit high metabolic rates when induced into quiescence via contact inhibition . By monitoring isotope labeling through metabolic pathways and quantitatively identifying fluxes from the data , we show that contact-inhibited fibroblasts utilize glucose in all branches of central carbon metabolism at rates similar to those of proliferating cells , with greater overflow flux from the pentose phosphate pathway back to glycolysis .

By feeding the cells labeled glutamine , we also detected a \" backwards \" flux in the tricarboxylic acid cycle from \u03b1-ketoglutarate to citrate that was enhanced in contact-inhibited fibroblasts ; this flux likely contributes to shuttling of NADPH from the mitochondrion to cytosol for redox defense or fatty acid synthesis . The high metabolic activity of the fibroblasts was directed in part toward breakdown and resynthesis of protein and lipid , and in part toward excretion of extracellular matrix proteins .

STUDY DESIGN From 233 patients with primary EOC who underwent surgery , pathological data were collected from pathology reports . Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the relationship between the presence of cysts and other tumor characteristics . RESULTS Cysts in EOC were present in 83.7% of the patients and were mostly ( 61% ) multilocular . The most common histological subtypes ( serous , mucinous , endometrioid , clear cell ) contained cysts in more than 85% of the cases . In univariate regression analysis , early FIGO stage , low tumor grade and a large tumor size were significantly associated with the presence of cysts ( OR ( 95% CI)=5.312 ( 1.81-15.57 ) , 6.906 ( 2.31-20.66 ) and 1.169 ( 1.08-1.27 ) , respectively ) .

Restoration of FBP1 expression suppressed anchorage-independent growth , indicating the relevance of FBP1 downregulation in carcinogenesis . Indeed , FBP1 was downregulated in gastric carcinomas ( P<0.01 , n=22 ) and gastric cancer cell lines ( 57% , 4/7 ) .

METHODS Baseline characteristics and outcomes on 170 patients treated with FOLFIRI or XELOX plus anti-VEGF therapy-naive metastatic colorectal cancer were collected from three Turkey cancer centers . Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors for OS . RESULTS The median OS for the whole cohort was 19 months ( 95% CI , 14.3 to 23.6 months ) .

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of TYMP , its association with other angiogenic factors , proliferation markers and , to our knowledge , for the first time its relationship with extracellular matrix components . MATERIALS AND METHODS Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded specimens from 97 patients with CRC were immunostained for TYMP , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , microvascular density ( CD34 ) , proliferation marker ( Ki-67 ) , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , p53 oncoprotein and extracellular matrix components ( collagen type IV , fibronectin , tenascin and laminin ) .

Humans , like mouse strains , display variations in dermal mast cell prevalence . In a study of Danish and South Australian BCC patients and control subjects , one 4-mm punch biopsy of non-sun-exposed buttock skin was sampled from each participant .

However , a direct relationship between growth factor signaling pathways and NF\u03baB activation has not been previously described , although FGFs have been known to antagonize TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here , we demonstrate an interaction between FGFR4 and IKK\u03b2 ( Inhibitor of NF\u03baB Kinase \u03b2 subunit ) , an essential component in the NF\u03baB pathway . This novel interaction was identified utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen [ 1 ] and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis . We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKK\u03b2 in the presence of activated FGFR4 , but not kinase-dead FGFR4 . Following stimulation by TNF\u03b1 ( Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1 ) to activate NF\u03baB pathways , FGFR4 activation results in significant inhibition of NF\u03baB signaling as measured by decreased nuclear NF\u03baB localization , by reduced NF\u03baB transcriptional activation in electophoretic mobility shift assays , and by inhibition of IKK\u03b2 kinase activity towards the substrate GST-I\u03baB\u03b1 in in vitro assays . FGF19 stimulation of endogenous FGFR4 in TNF\u03b1-treated DU145 prostate cancer cells also leads to a decrease in IKK\u03b2 activity , concomitant reduction in NF\u03baB nuclear localization , and reduced apoptosis .

Annexin V assay , cell cycle , and activation of caspase-3 demonstrates that YM155 induced apoptosis in SK-NEP-1 cells . YM155 significantly inhibited growth of SK-NEP-1 xenografts ( YM155 5 mg/kg : 1.45 +/- 0.77 cm3 ; YM155 10 mg/kg : 0.95 +/- 0.55 cm3 ) compared to DMSO group ( DMSO : 3.70 +/- 2.4 cm3 ) or PBS group cells ( PBS : 3.78 +/- 2.20 cm3 , ANOVA P < 0.01 ) . YM155 treatment decreased weight of tumors ( YM155 5 mg/kg : 1.05 +/- 0.24 g ; YM155 10 mg/kg : 0.72 +/- 0.17 g ) compared to DMSO group ( DMSO : 2.06 +/- 0.38 g ) or PBS group cells ( PBS : 2.36 +/- 0.43 g , ANOVA P < 0.01 ) . Real-time PCR array analysis showed between Test group and control group there are 32 genes significantly up-regulated and 54 genes were significantly down-regulated after YM155 treatment . Ingenuity pathway analysis ( IPA ) showed cell death was the highest rated network with 65 focus molecules and the significance score of 44 . The IPA analysis also groups the differentially expressed genes into biological mechanisms that are related to cell death , cellular function maintenance , cell morphology , carbohydrate metabolism and cellular growth and proliferation . Death receptor signaling ( 3.87E-19 ) , TNFR1 signaling , induction of apoptosis by HIV1 , apoptosis signaling and molecular mechanisms of cancer came out to be the top four most significant pathways . IPA analysis also showed top molecules up-regulated were BBC3 , BIRC3 , BIRC8 , BNIP1 , CASP7 , CASP9 , CD5 , CDKN1A , CEBPG and COL4A3 , top molecules down-regulated were ZNF443 , UTP11L , TP73 , TNFSF10 , TNFRSF1B , TNFRSF25 , TIAF1 , STK17A , SST and SPP1 , upstream regulator were NR3C1 , TP53 , dexamethasone , TNF and Akt . CONCLUSIONS : The present study demonstrates that YM155 treatment resulted in apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1cells . YM155 had significant role and little side effect in the treatment of SK-NEP-1 xenograft tumors . Real-time PCR array analysis firstly showed expression profile of genes dyes-regulated after YM155 treatment . IPA analysis also represents new molecule mechanism of YM155 treatment , such as NR3C1 and dexamethasone may be new target of YM155 .

To examine whether a treatment with 60-minute 41.8 degrees C WBH as an adjunct to chemotherapy ( WBH-CT ) induces an activation of T cells , blood samples were collected at numerous time points before and up to 48 h post-treatment . The aim of this study was to examine the effect of WBH-CT on the expression of a broad range of activation markers on peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) , on serum cytokines and intracellular cytokine levels in T cells , and the capacity of these cells to proliferate . Immediately after 41.8 degrees C WBH-CT treatment , a drastic increase in peripheral natural killer ( NK ) cells ( P<0.05 ) and CD56+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ; P<0.01 ) in the patients ' peripheral blood was observed . At 5 h post-treatment , the percentages of both effector cell types had returned to baseline levels . This transient phenomenon was accompanied by a short period of reduced T cell activity , indicated by diminished serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors ( sIL-2R ) at 3 h post-WBH-CT ( P<0.05 ) and decreased lymphocytic proliferation at the same point in time . This first phase was followed by a marked but short-lived increase in the patients ' serum levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ; P<0.01 ) during the first 5 h following treatment , with a subsequent decrease to baseline levels at 24 h and significantly increased serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) at 0 h ( P<0.01 ) , 3 h ( P<0.05 ) , 5 h ( P<0.05 ) and 24 h ( P<0.01 ) post-WBH-CT . The third phase of the immunological consequences of WBH-CT consisted of an increase in the percentage of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) expressing CD56 , reaching a maximum at 48 h post-WBH ( P<0.01 ) . Furthermore , the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing the T cell activation marker CD69 increased nearly two-fold over time , reaching its maximum at 48 h ( P<0.05 ) . As an additional marker for T cell activation , serum levels of sIL-2R increased markedly ( P<0.01 ) , reaching maximum levels at the same point in time . Elevated intracellular concentrations of interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and/or TNF-alpha in CD8+ T cells were found in 4 out of 5 patients at 24 h post-WBH-CT .

{"sentence": "BACKGROUND Anti-angiogenic treatment of glioblastoma characteristically results in therapy resistance and tumor progression via diffuse infiltration . Monitoring tumor progression in these patients is thwarted because therapy results in tumor invisibility in contrast-enhanced ( CE ) MRI . To address this problem , we examined whether tumor progression could be monitored by metabolic mapping using ( 1)H MR spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) . METHODS We treated groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice carrying different orthotopic diffuse-infiltrative glioblastoma xenografts with bevacizumab ( anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] antibody , n = 13 ) , cabozantinib ( combined VEGF receptor 2/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor , n = 11 ) , or placebo ( n = 15 ) and compared CE-MRI with MRS-derived metabolic maps before , during , and after treatment . Metabolic maps and CE-MRIs were subsequently correlated to histology and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS In vivo imaging of choline/n-acetyl aspartate ratios via multivoxel MRS is better able to evaluate response to therapy than CE-MRI . Lactate imaging revealed that diffuse infiltrative areas in glioblastoma xenografts did not present with excessive glycolysis . In contrast , glycolysis was observed in hypoxic areas in angiogenesis-dependent compact regions of glioma only , especially after anti-angiogenic treatment . CONCLUSION Our data present MRSI as a powerful and feasible approach that is superior to CE-MRI and may provide handles for optimizing treatment of glioma . Furthermore , we show that glycolysis is more prominent in hypoxic areas than in areas of diffuse infiltrative growth .

We hypotheses that PTEN gene could affect the growth and viability of ASMCs through the regulation of PI3K/Akt , MAPK , and cell cycle-related gene expression . We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to transfect ASMCs . Cells were divided into the overexpression of PTEN gene group ( Ad-PTEN-GFP ) , negative control group ( Ad-GFP ) , and blank control group ( DMEM ) .

In vitro studies using rat aortic ring assay showed that luteolin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and proliferation , migration , invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells , which are key events in the process of angiogenesis . Luteolin also inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay ( CAM ) and matrigel plug assay . Gelatin zymographic analysis demonstrated the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the activation of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 . Western blot analysis showed that luteolin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT , ERK , mTOR , P70S6K , MMP-2 , and MMP-9 in HUVECs . Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-\u03b1 level were significantly reduced by the treatment of luteolin in PC-3 cells . Luteolin ( 10 mg/kg/d ) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model , indicating that luteolin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis . CD31 and CD34 immunohistochemical staining further revealed that the microvessel density could be remarkably suppressed by luteolin . Moreover , luteolin reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells , which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT , ERK , mTOR , P70S6K , MMP-2 , and MMP-9 expressions .

Although Fbxo31 depletion in MEFs increased cyclin D1 abundance , this effect appeared attributable to upregulation of cyclin D1 mRNA . Furthermore , abrogation of the function of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein ( SCF ) complex or the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ( APC/C ) complexes did not alter the half-life of cyclin D1 , whereas cyclin D1 degradation was dependent largely on proteasome activity .

However , the relationship between them has not been studied to date . We hypothesized that Flt-1 and Flk-1 expression in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients could be closely related to baseline peritoneal transport status . METHODS Thirty-six new patients without a previous history of peritonitis were enrolled . Clinical parameters such as age , sex , height , weight , causes of renal failure , and residual renal function were assessed . Parietal peritoneal biopsies were obtained during implantation of peritoneal dialytic catheters . Flt-1 and Flk-1 were semi-quantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical staining . Peritoneal microvascular density ( MVD ) was counted . Within 6 weeks after commencing peritoneal dialysis , a standard peritoneal equilibration test was performed , and the dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratio for creatinine at 4 h ( D4/P Cr ) was determined . The patients were divided into two groups based on the D4/P Cr : more than 0.65 ( Group H , n = 22 ) and less than or equal to 0.65 ( Group L , n = 14 ) . The 24-h peritoneal protein excretion ( PPE ) was assayed . Flt-1 and Flk-1 were correlated with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE .

ZFN introduced targeted DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) and initiated non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) after pronuclear or cytoplasmatic microinjection into zygotes . Resulting frame shift mutations led to functional gene ablations in zebra fish , mice , pigs and also in laboratory rats . Therefore , we targeted the rat Rag1 gene essential for the V(D)J recombination within the immunoglobulin production process and for the differentiation of mature B and T lymphocytes to generate an immunodeficient rat model in the LEW/Ztm strain . RESULTS After microinjection of Rag1 specific ZFN mRNAs in 623 zygotes of inbred LEW/Ztm rats 59 offspring were born from which one carried a 4 bp deletion . This frame shift mutation led to a premature stop codon and a subsequently truncated Rag1 protein confirmed by the loss of the full-length protein in Western Blot analysis . Truncation of the Rag1 protein was characterized by the complete depletion of mature B cells . The remaining T cell population contained mature CD4+/CD3+/TCR\\u03b1\\u03b2+ as well as CD8+/CD3+/TCR\\u03b1\\u03b2+ positive lymphocytes accompanied by a compensatory increase of natural killer cells in the peripheral blood . Reduction of T cell development in Rag1 mutant rats was associated with a hypoplastic thymus that lacked follicular structures .

Skin tumors were initiated by applying 160 nmol DMBA and promoted by twice weekly applications of 8.5 nmol TPA for 28 wk . All mice developed tumors by 13 wk of promotion . However , in mice pretreated with 30 microL eugenol , no tumors were detected until 8 wk ( following anti-initiation protocol ) and until 14 wk ( following antipromotion protocol ) of tumor promotion . PCNA and TUNEL immunohistochemistry of tumors revealed eugenol to ameliorate cell proliferation and elevate apoptosis respectively . The effect of eugenol was assessed on specific stages of carcinogenesis . Initiation with DMBA led to a significant upregulation of p53 expression with a concomitant increase in p21(WAF1) levels in epidermal cells indicating induction of damage to the DNA . However , pretreatment with eugenol led to overexpression of these genes , which probably helped stimulate apoptosis of the initiated cells . To ascertain the molecular mechanisms implicated in the antitumor promoting activity of eugenol , its effect was investigated on markers of tumor promotion and inflammation : ODC activity and iNOS and COX-2 expression , and on levels of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , TNF-alpha , and PGE(2) ) . Eugenol markedly inhibited all . Eugenol also inhibited the upstream signaling molecule : NF-kappaB , which regulates the expression of these genes .

Our recent research has implied that BMP-6 may suppress breast cancer metastasis . In the present study , we extended to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which BMP-6 exerts its anti-tumorigenic effect . METHODS The Boyden chamber assay was used to examine the ability of BMP-6 and HO-1 in MCF-7 malignant progress . RT-PCR , western blot , luciferase assay , and quantitative CHIP were used to determine the potential mechanism and signaling pathways by which BMP-6 and HO-1 function as anti-metastatic factors in MCF-7 cells . RESULTS The Boyden chamber assay showed that BMP-6 inhibited the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells , which effect was significantly deprived by knockdown of HO-1 . We further demonstrated that BMP-6 treatment resulted in an activation of HO-1 transcription through the recruitment of Smad1/5 to the Smad-responsive element on its promoter . In addition , BMP-6-induced up-regulation of HO-1 exhibited an inhibitory effect on MMP-9 secretion in a paracrine action in MCF-7 cells . Overexpression of BMP-6 and HO-1 synergistically suppressed MMP-9 transcription , which effect was specifically mediated via the MAPK/p38/AP-1 signaling .

{"sentence": "In lung cancer , platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1 ( PDGFR\u03b1 ) is expressed frequently by tumor-associated stromal cells and by cancer cells in a subset of tumors . We sought to determine the effect of targeting stromal PDGFR\u03b1 in preclinical lung tumor xenograft models ( human tumor , mouse stroma ) . Effects of anti-human ( IMC-3G3 ) and anti-mouse ( 1E10 ) PDGFR\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) on proliferation and PDGFR\u03b1 signaling were evaluated in lung cancer cell lines and mouse fibroblasts . Therapy studies were conducted using established PDGFR\u03b1-positive H1703 cells and PDGFR\u03b1-negative Calu-6 , H1993 , and A549 subcutaneous tumors in immunocompromised mice treated with vehicle , anti-PDGFR\u03b1 mAbs , chemotherapy , or combination therapy . Tumors were analyzed for growth and levels of growth factors . IMC-3G3 inhibited PDGFR\u03b1 activation and the growth of H1703 cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo , but had no effect on PDGFR\u03b1-negative cell lines or mouse fibroblasts. 1E10 inhibited growth and PDGFR\u03b1 activation of mouse fibroblasts , but had no effect on human cancer cell lines in vitro . In vivo , 1E10-targeted inhibition of murine PDGFR\u03b1 reduced tumor growth as single-agent therapy in Calu-6 cells and enhanced the effect of chemotherapy in xenografts derived from A549 cells . We also identified that low expression cancer cell expression of VEGF-A and elevated expression of PDGF-AA were associated with response to stromal PDGFR\u03b1 targeting . We conclude that stromal PDGFR\u03b1 inhibition represents a means for enhancing control of lung cancer growth in some cases , independent of tumor cell PDGFR\u03b1 expression .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "id": "22933705"}
{"sentence": "BACKGROUND Apigenin , a natural plant flavone , may have chemopreventive and therapeutic potentials for anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , and anti-cancer . Nevertheless , the anti-tumor effect of apigenin on human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is not fully understood . METHODS The antioxidant capacity and protective effects of apigenin against oxidative stress in murine normal embryonic liver BNLCL2 cells are examined . Cell viability , morphologic change , clonogenic survival , cell cycle distribution , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , glutathione formation , and death receptors- and Bcl-2-mediated caspase pathways of HNSCC SCC25 cells and A431 cells with apigenin are investigated . RESULTS Apigenin inhibits the growth of SCC25 and A431 cells and induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase . Apigenin has an antioxidant capacity as well as the ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation . It protects BNLCL2 cells against oxidative damage , and is potentially able to prevent cancer . Apigenin increases intracellular ROS levels and reduces levels of glutathione ; it also induces cell apoptosis via tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNF-R)- , TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor ( TRAIL-R)- , and Bcl-2-mediated caspase-dependent cell death pathways in SCC25 cells . The combination of apigenin with 5-fluorouracil ( 5-Fu ) or cisplatin induces the dramatic death of SCC25 cells . CONCLUSIONS Apigenin induces SCC25 cell apoptosis via the up-regulation of both TNF-R and TRAIL-R signaling pathways , and has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of cell proliferation in combination with 5-Fu or cisplatin . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE These analytical findings suggest that apigenin may be a good therapeutic agent against HNSCC cells .", "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "id": "22554915"}
{"sentence": "Changes at the invariable donor splice site +1 guanine , relatively frequent in human genetic disease , are predicted to abrogate correct splicing , and thus are classified as null mutations . However , their ability to direct residual expression , which might have pathophysiological implications in several diseases , has been poorly investigated . As a model to address this issue , we studied the IVS6+1G>T mutation found in patients with severe deficiency of the protease triggering coagulation , factor VII ( FVII ) , whose absence is considered lethal . In expression studies , the IVS6+1G>T induced exon 6 skipping and frame-shift , and prevented synthesis of correct FVII transcripts detectable by radioactive/fluorescent labelling or real-time RT-PCR . Intriguingly , the mutation induced the activation of a cryptic donor splice site in exon 6 and production of an in-frame 30bp deleted transcript ( 8 \u00b1 2% ) . Expression of this cDNA variant , lacking 10 residues in the activation domain , resulted in secretion of trace amounts ( 0.2 \u00b1 0.04% ) of protein with appreciable specific activity ( 48 \u00b1 16% of wt-FVII ) . Altogether these data indicate that the IVS6+1G>T mutation is compatible with the synthesis of functional FVII molecules ( of normal , 1pM ) , which could trigger coagulation . The low but detectable thrombin generation ( 352 \u00b1 55nM ) measured in plasma from an IVS6+1G>T homozygote was consistent with a minimal initiation of the enzymatic cascade .

Indeed , the FDA approval of bortezomib , the first class of general proteasome inhibitor , for the treatment of multiple myeloma , demonstrated that the UPS can be an attractive anti-cancer target . However , normal cell toxicity associated with bortezomib , resulting from global inhibition of protein degradation , promotes the focus of drug discovery efforts on targeting enzymes upstream of the proteasome for better specificity .

Activity of CRLs is dynamically regulated and requires the RING component and cullin neddylation . In this review , we will introduce the UPS and CRL E3s and discuss the biological processes regulated by each of eight CRLs through substrate degradation .

{"sentence": "OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression profiles of serum Golgi protein-73 ( GP73 ) in liver cirrhosis and primary hepatic carcinoma ( PHC ) and determine its clinical value for differential diagnosis . METHODS Serum protein expressions of GP73 and alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemiluminescence assay , respectively , in patients with PHC ( n=80 ) , liver cirrhosis ( n=65 ) , and healthy controls ( n=50 ) . Inter-group changes were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test , and significance of these differences was assessed by Mann- Whitney test . A receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve was plotted to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency and determine the cut-off values for GP73 and AFP . Sensitivity and specificity were compared by the Chi-squared test . Correlation between serum GP73 expression and clinical parameters was determined by Spearman's rank correlation analysis . RESULTS The PHC group showed significantly higher serum GP73 ( 282.0 mug/L ) than the liver cirrhosis group ( 211.8 mug/L ) and control group ( 58.3 mug/L ) ( H = 93.30 , P less than 0.01 ) . For differential diagnosis of PHC and liver cirrhosis , the cut-off value was 318.1 mug/L for GP73 and 13.4 mug/L for AFP . Sensitivity of GP73 was lower than AFP ( 45% ( 36/80 ) vs. 65% ( 52/80 ) ; X2 = 8.02 , P less than 0.05 ) . Specificity of GP73 was lower than AFP but no significance was found ( 83.1% ( 54/65 ) vs. 87.7% ( 57/65 ) ; X2=0.27 , P more than 0.05 ) . The areas under the ROC curves were not significantly different between GP73 and AFP ( 0.65 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.54 vs. 0.75 ( 95% CI : 0.67 Z = 1.88 , P more than 0.05 ) . The area under the ROC curves increased but not significantly ( 0.80 ( 95% CI : 0.73 vs. 0.75 ( 95% CI : 0.67 Z=2.61 , P more than 0.05 ) . Serum GP73 was correlated with liver cirrhosis ( r=0.27 ) , vascular invasion ( r=0.29 ) , and TNM staging ( r=0.27 ) ( all P less than 0.05 ) , but not with sex ( r=0.13 ) , age ( r=0.10 ) , enhanced AFP ( > 13.4 mug/L ; r=0.03 ) , tumor size ( r=0.18 ) , or distant metastasis ( r=0.04 ) , all P less than 0.05 .

{"sentence": "Breast cancer incidence is increased in women receiving menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin but not with estrogen alone . The use of a tissue-selective estrogen complex ( TSEC ) has been proposed as a novel menopausal hormone therapy strategy to eliminate the requirement for a progestogen . Combination of bazedoxifene ( BZA ) with conjugated estrogens ( CEs ) , the first TSEC , has shown beneficial effects . Whether it would exert antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer is not clear . To address this issue , we compared estradiol ( E(2) ) and CE alone on proliferation and apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells . CE stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells at a peak concentration 10-fold higher than required for E(2) . Both CE and E(2) alone increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis with activation of MAPK , Akt , and p70S6K and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors survivin , Bcl-2 , and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein , These effects could be completely blocked by BZA . Gene expression studies demonstrated that CE and E(2) were equally potent on expression of cMyc , pS2 , and WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2 , whereas the stimulatory effects of CE on progesterone receptor and amphiregulin expression were weaker than E(2) . BZA effectively blocked each of these effects and showed no estrogen agonistic effects when used alone . Our results indicate that the stimulatory effects of E(2) or CE on breast cancer cells could be completely abrogated by BZA .
