# KBioXLM
## Introduction

Multilingual Biomedical PLM-KBioXLM

## Installation Tutorial

1. Torch
2. Transformers
3. Deepspeed
4. Tensorboard

## Instructions for use

1. Firstly, in pre-training: ① XLMR+Pre training: Process first_ Data, pre train after obtaining data; ② KBioXLM follows the same steps as XLMR+Pretraining
2. After obtaining the KBioXLM model, call the model in downstream to verify its effectiveness
